    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>This week my task was to figure out how to implement responsive typography. </p>
    <h3>The opportunity for creative  typography and layout</h3>
   
 <p>A <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/12/smashing-podcast-episode-5/">Smashing podcast with Jason Pamental</a> was interesting; Jason talks about how web sites are drifting toward a style of a single column of well-set type, and how this will eventually become boring. He said there's a need to insert more personality into sites.  I think this is a good reminder that we're seeing a current trend rather than the answer to how type should look on a page. I like remembering that I have the opportunity to create something new and introduce new ways of thinking about what can develop from the accessible layouts we're trying to establish.</p>
 <p>From the podcast:</p>
   <blockquote><p>We have all these capabilities in CSS that allow us to do really interesting things with margins and layout. I mean, it’s not even just the fact that we have grid now. But the fact that we can do calculations in the browser in CSS allows us to do a lot more interesting stuff. You layer in with that, the ability to be much more expressive with type, then we could start to look at what they do in magazines. Vanity Fair doesn’t have one article template. They have six or seven or eight. If you really look at how they lay those things out, there’s a tremendous amount of variability but it is playing within a system.</p>

<p>So when we create a design system for our website, instead of stopping at just one layout, we have a relatively easy way to build some switches into our content management systems. Most of them support a fair amount of flexibility. There’s no reason why we couldn’t give people a choice. I want to use layout one, two, three, four, five, six. That’s going to introduce different margins, different offsets. Maybe introducing the ability to create some columns. There’s lots of different things that we could do that would make for a much more interesting web. I think that type can play a really big part in that.</p></blockquote>


 
   <h3>Avoid pixels</h3>

     
          <p>A good find was an article by Kathleen McMahon of 24 Accessibility (<a href="https://www.24a11y.com/2019/pixels-vs-relative-units-in-css-why-its-still-a-big-deal/">Pixels vs. Relative Units in CSS: why it’s still a big deal</a>, 2019). The article addresses why it's important to avoid using pixels in css. She also writes about the same experience I had this week, where I found so many contradictory pieces of information. Says McMahon: </p>
        <blockquote><p>When I first started looking up recommendations on whether or not using pixels in CSS in general is a good idea, I’d find conflicting opinions on the subject, such as articles <a href="https://benfrain.com/just-use-pixels/">like this one</a>  describing why you should just use pixels or should <a href="https://medium.com/@julienetienne/pixels-are-dead-faa87cd8c8b9">stop using pixels in CSS</a>. [This article by Zell] ...about <a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/media-query-units/">responsive sizing in media queries</a> [which argues to use em, not pixels, for media queries]. Even a good article about Accessibility in Resizing Text about the behavior of older browsers.</p>

          <p>There wasn’t much mention — or consideration — that users really do dig into the advanced browser settings to change their default font size.</p></blockquote>
  <p>The McMahon article addresses setting only a single value for font size and line height (e.g., font-size: 1rem, line-height: 1.5) rather than the more complex formulas others proposal for a fluid typography experience. </p>
        
           <h3>The first sketch, and the need for clamp()</h3>

            <p>Several days ago I started out by using the following calculation for font size from Heydon Pickering (see sketch 1). He proposes using the following code:</p>
            <code>html {
              font-size: calc(1em + 1vw);
            }</code>
            <p>The problem with this approach is that text becomes too large as the viewport becomes larger. I've learned that it's necessary to limit the upper end of the range.  </p>
            
            <p>Other sources later told me that using vw to specify font sizes is a problem when users adjust their default font size. I see that if I adjust the browser's default font size, the text size on my sample  page adjusts, so presumably the 1em part of the calculation overcomes the otherwise problematic (potentially inaccessible?) vw part of the calculation? It seems odd that Pickering would advise something that has accessibility issues?</p>

      <h3>A dead end</h3>
<p>I never got around to troubleshooting this  example from Jason Pamental's presentation at the 2019 Beyond Tellerrand conference ("Dynamic typography with variable fonts"). When I put the following css in my code it doesn't seem to have any effect, and I get a css validation error that i can't solve:</p>
  <code>
    /* Please scale from 2.25em on small screens up to 5em on largest ones, starting at vw of 25em and stopping at 75em or larger. */<br><br>

        font-size:  calc([size-min]em + ([size-max] - [size-min]) * 
      ((100vw - [start]em) / ([stop] - [start])));</code>
    </li>

              <h3>Avoid viewport widths. No, use them. Don't know.</h3>
            <p>In his <a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/viewport-based-typography/">Viewport Unit Based Typography</a> article (9 March 2016), Zell Liew proposes setting a minimum font-size, then scaling the font with a small viewport multiple by using the calc() property. Note the use of pixel measurements, which we know is a problem:</p>
              <code>
                html { font-size: calc(18px + 0.25vw) }
              </code>

              <p>Zell says he learned about this technique through Mike Riethmuller’s 2015 <a href="https://www.madebymike.com.au/writing/precise-control-responsive-typography/">Precise control over responsive typography</a> article. Unfortunately, he says that the code doesn’t work on some browsers. Specifically, it doesn’t resize on Safari for Mac, and I don't see updated information about whether this is still true.</p>

              <p>The fix, says Zell, is to combine the use of a percentage unit with viewport width to allow Safari to scale the fonts:</p>
              <code>html { font-size: calc(112.5% + 0.5vw) }</code>
              <p>I'm really confused about whether the use of vw to calculate font size breaks accessibility guidelines. Does this work okay if  a user has low vision and resets the default browser font size?</p>
            
          <h3>The simplicity of clamp()...but with the use of vw and pixels</h3>  
          <p>I figured I needed to focus on clamp in order to eliminate problems at small and large viewport sizes. I liked the simplicity of what designcourse.com advises in a <a href="https://youtu.be/dg488RrpNTc">fluid typography video</a>, but he uses both pixel and viewport width measurements along with ems, and I don't think that is appropriate. Right?</p>
                <code>h1 { font-size: clamp(40px, 5vw, 70px); }<br>
                p { font-size: clamp(1em, 2vw, 2em); }</code>

       
      
                <p>Yet the clamp spec. itself uses pixels:</p>
                <code>html {<br>
                  font-family: sans-serif;<br>
                }<br><br>

                body {<br>
                margin: 0 auto;<br>
                width: min(1000px, calc(70% + 100px));<br>
              }<br><br>

              h1 {<br>
              letter-spacing: 2px;<br>
              font-size: clamp(1.8rem, 2.5vw, 2.8rem);<br>
            }<br><br>

            p {<br>
            line-height: 1.5;<br>
            font-size: max(1.2rem, 1.2vw);<br>
          }
        </code>
 
    <h3>Conclusion</h3> 
    <p>I'm still confused. I have a working example in sketch #6, though I'm not fully happy with it. I leaned on the example in the clamp() spec, then tweaked it to shorten line length and reduce font size overall. I may return to using aspects of the earlier sketches, but modifying them for use with clamp(). Sketch #7 also has promise and is the basis of the css on this page.</p>
    <p>This has been a difficult week; the concepts seem so straightforward, but they're not.</p>
