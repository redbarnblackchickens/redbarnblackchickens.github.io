				<h1>Sample #3: Jessica Chan's responsive typography alculation</h1>
			</header>


			<p>A <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/the-elements-of-responsive-typography/">2019 article by Jessica Chan</a> reviews different approaches to responsive typography, all of which feel like dead ends:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Set <code>html { font-size: 100%; }</code>, then set font sizes for various element using rems, and add media queries to deal with different device sizes.</p>
					<p>The h1 on this page was huge when I used that calculation, so I reduced it to <code>
			h1 {font-size: calc(1rem + 2.5vw)}
</code>.</p>


				</li>

				<li>Introduce the calc() function: <code>h1 {
					font-size: calc(1.3rem + 3.6vw);
				}</code><p>But, as she notes, there are accessibility issues with viewport units, and media queries will be necessary.</p></li>
				<li>	<p>Or, as another option, I can perform the following calculation to establish font sizes:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/minimum-font-size-nocdn-768x160.png" alt="frightening looking multi-part formula to calculate font size, complex enough that it doesn't make sense to spell out the details, because the point is that we're going to abandon the calculation"><figcaption>From the J. Chan article, an inaccessible image (no alt text!) that shows an approach to calculate responsive font sizes.</figcaption></figure><p>Are you kidding me? No.</p></li>
				</ol>
				<p>Jessica's conclusion is to do something like the following...which she acknowledges has issues.</p><code>h1 {
					font-size: calc(1.3rem + 3.6vw);
				}</code>
