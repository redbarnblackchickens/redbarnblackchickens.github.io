Valerie Stoehr: Like, I think I fell in love with them last fall and like, oh my god, I must make cranberries, all the time. I must, you know, elevate the cranberry and then I never acted on it. Right.

12
00:00:47.550 --> 00:01:08.580
Valerie Stoehr: There's a bag of frozen cranberries, there was a bag in the freezer that had just been looking at me all year long that I hadn't done anything with. So, you know, can do me. So we had an orange. You know, so orange zest orange juice Carmen close apples cranberries like oh my

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.210
Valerie Stoehr: My little Frozen Lemon juice cubes, since we didn't have two bags of lemons and

19
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:40.440
Valerie Stoehr: We didn't make cornbread. I might do that today. But yeah, so that'll fried chicken, you know, the tofu that's fried chicken with over nutritional yeast, like all over it, some butter, salt.

20
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.840
Valerie Stoehr: That's good. Oh, and then for dessert. I'm very proud of my dessert. So

21
00:01:49.890 --> 00:02:05.250
Valerie Stoehr: It's how to make here like a fake here really quickly without Darien without like sugar. Sugar so equal parts of almond flour and dates.

22
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.480
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, in the VitaMix. So I did about a half a cup of

23
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:26.070
Valerie Stoehr: Almond flour about a very generous half a cup of date cell Preston, you know, to a half cup thing about three times as much water and then Vitamix that fucker. And then, um, and then I added

24
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.060
Valerie Stoehr: A tablespoon or two or, you know, I added chia seeds and put it in the fridge.

25
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.110
Valerie Stoehr: XO became

26
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.140
Valerie Stoehr: This lovely putting that back with saffron and Carmen in it.

27
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:50.640
Valerie Stoehr: Nice. And so it just became this luscious sweet. It was like having care. You know, it's like having this lovely rice pudding thing and

28
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.580
mctavish: Nice.

29
00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.300
Valerie Stoehr: Like we haven't really been having desserts. We haven't the cake, the cake train slowed down.

30
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.000
Valerie Stoehr: Since Carol made that olive oil cake and because it's just so overwhelming to have, like, you know, a full

31
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.360
mctavish: Yeah.

32
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.590
You know,

33
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.200
Valerie Stoehr: So it's really nice.

34
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.980
Valerie Stoehr: Excellent. How about you guys.

35
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.890
mctavish: Oh, she made a really good cornbread.

36
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.140
mctavish: Stuffing

37
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.150
mctavish: Young some chicken with that just a little bit of chicken with that and then

38
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:38.070
mctavish: And then I cranberries thing. You know I love coffee, so I wish you could grow cranberries is you're like, hi bush cranberries have a similar kind of idea, but not quite. And then at the end, then we had

39
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.430
mctavish: Pumpkin Pie. We had a pumpkin from the food farm know for my day.

40
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.900
mctavish: So I've been saving it to make it the thing about it like I usually always make squashed by and in fact was in Kansas actually squash.

41
00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:01.440
mctavish: You know, how can play Kansas actually switch and it really is true. It's a little bit more stringy you know you know it's not quite as rigid great a squash so

42
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.180
mctavish: That was medium.

43
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.590
mctavish: Okay but she'll made a little caramel sauce on the top. So that was

44
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.390
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, that works.

45
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.230
mctavish: That improved it

46
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.580
mctavish: And then we have some brussels sprouts.

47
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.660
Valerie Stoehr: Oh, yeah.

48
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.330
mctavish: For the food term still so it's like I was just low key we watch too stupid.

49
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.050
mctavish: Coming out lesbian holiday movies.

50
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.620
mctavish: And and and then play Scrabble.

51
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.520
Valerie Stoehr: So, yeah.

52
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.190
mctavish: It's kind of a silly.

53
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.640
Yeah.

54
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.180
Valerie Stoehr: It was bookended before the big cooking. We had zoom with my

55
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.080
Valerie Stoehr: Sister's family is in Ohio, because they drove to see John's sister why

56
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.980
Valerie Stoehr: So, whatever. And then, um,

57
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.620
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, the, the family in Kenyan that we usually have Thanksgiving with

58
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.250
mctavish: Wizard with

59
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.760
Valerie Stoehr: I think there might be a similar dynamic going on because

60
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.090
Valerie Stoehr: You know there's cousins who are just hold up in

61
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:22.410
Valerie Stoehr: Wisconsin, you know, and then there's we have a cousin really nice guy, Michael, and he he doesn't have a lot of money pays as old as I am. He's working like on construction sites that column Grampa because like, you know, no, it's all these young man.

62
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.580
Valerie Stoehr: So like he was working in South Dakota, with some of that.

63
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.690
Valerie Stoehr: Stuff you know he's a lefty, so he's

64
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.740
mctavish: Yeah.

65
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.820
You know,

66
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.580
Valerie Stoehr: So he doesn't really fit in with the crowd. But, you know, like, it's what he's doing. He had this

67
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.510
Valerie Stoehr: Other job and there was a divorce and

68
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.590
mctavish: Yeah.

69
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.640
Valerie Stoehr: You know, he

70
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:55.290
Valerie Stoehr: knows what he's doing, you know, and so he's traveling around to these different sites. Try not to get carpet and where was he, he is with my aunt and uncle.

71
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.980
Yeah.

72
00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.450
mctavish: So credit. Yeah.

73
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.500
Valerie Stoehr: He was even talking about, you know, like we asked him about

74
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:12.210
Valerie Stoehr: What he's trying to do. And he talked about trying to stay safe and you know he sounded like super reasonable, but then like, why are you there. I don't

75
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.470
mctavish: Understand, right.

76
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:23.670
mctavish: I know because I'm not afraid of getting it from them, you know, it's like the people that are the pollinators is like it's kinda like they missed the other part of that that that phrase, you know,

77
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.240
mctavish: But they could get it from you.

78
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.020
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah. Oh, and then we zoomed with Carol's cousins in Detroit.

79
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.600
Valerie Stoehr: And it was nice. And then we watched like an episode and a half from the British Bake Off.

80
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.420
Valerie Stoehr: As Carol's new to that.

81
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.500
mctavish: Yeah, funny.

82
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:51.270
Valerie Stoehr: I've already gone through, like I did one binge of like the last season, I think. But I think we're looking at the original season right now.

83
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.670
Valerie Stoehr: And it's fun.

84
00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:04.950
mctavish: Interesting. Yeah, it's just I know it's like it's just hard to even watch mysteries, because it's hard to see death in all right now. It just feels like there's so much stress is like

85
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.370
mctavish: See violence or something.

86
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.150
Yeah.

87
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.670
mctavish: Yeah.

88
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:22.950
mctavish: But that that will be transit. That was really good. It was kind of a combination. It was between Casablanca and and like, did you see a big vendors

89
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:40.500
mctavish: They call it, it's not. It's called sky over Berlin or something and in in German, but it's a it's called here. It's called a Wings of Desire, or something like that. Yeah, that's a great phone that's, that's one of my favorite films of all time, actually.

90
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.750
mctavish: So, but

91
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.610
mctavish: Anyway,

92
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:49.590
mctavish: WOW, THAT IT'S LIKE THAT. THAT IT WAS SO IT WAS THAT WAS A TREAT BECAUSE

93
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.390
mctavish: It's just nice. Once all the accidentally get a good film instead of

94
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.060
mctavish: Yeah, there's so much trash, you know,

95
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.300
mctavish: Yeah, and me.

96
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.460

99
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:19.140
mctavish: Something with a brand new navigation. So I just skipped the icons. It just felt like I showed it to my dad is kind of like

100
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:28.680
mctavish: A user tests like with Rachel fish. You know what I mean. So, so, and I could just tell like no one knows the turn on the sound. They just don't

101
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.410
Valerie Stoehr: Right. And then even my sister.

102
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:41.760
mctavish: Was like, you know, it's like, because everyone thinks of visual stuff when you go out, you're on the web. You know, it's like they're not like okay and where do I turn on the sound like no one's asking that question. Remember

103
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:42.630
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

104
00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.680
mctavish: You know, unless it's a movie.

105
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.600
Valerie Stoehr: Unless it looks like a movie.

106
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:50.910
mctavish: Yeah, so, so I just that just forget it.

131
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.080
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

132
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.900
mctavish: Because it's just like when you go back. It's just too long.

133
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.290
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, I know. It's like, and I did, I did love

mctavish: The open endurance.

135
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:25.830
Valerie Stoehr: You know, but yeah, then

136
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.920
Valerie Stoehr: It's like it's trying to do two different things.

137
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:43.380
mctavish: Right, right. So if you just kind of go through and then I'm not sure about the order of the box, really, my dad thought that like Sheila's words are a little bit more understandable, but when he went to field notes right away. He was so frustrated because very well.

138
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.510
mctavish: Yeah, and he tried to

139
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.130
Valerie Stoehr: You know, yeah.

140
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.900
Valerie Stoehr: Oh, yeah.

141
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.830
mctavish: So he said, like it can seem like what it is. If you've already gotten a

142
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.690
mctavish: You know, I mean,

143
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.210
Valerie Stoehr: Like yeah, do a starter kind of

144
00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.580
mctavish: Yeah, so you sort of disintegrated into this

145
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.240
mctavish: Yes.

146
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.900
mctavish: In other words, you have mixed feelings about that but

147
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.080
Yes, obviously.

148
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.130
mctavish: Like these, this first two now are Sheila's words.

149
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:21.540
mctavish: You know, you're going to going right into her space more which may be as good as fine.

150
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:22.680
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

151
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.430
mctavish: You know, I mean,

152
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.640
mctavish: Yeah. And then I kind of rub off on you slowly or something but

153
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.110
mctavish: I'm just not quite sure about that.

154
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.420
mctavish: About the order you know

155
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.030
mctavish: Yeah, and a PR words obviously are

156
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:39.060
mctavish: You know she's a poet. So it's like their meaning. You know what I mean that it has more

157
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.940
mctavish: Yeah, so maybe that's the way to go.

158
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.200
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah I don't know either. That makes sense to me.

159
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.070
Valerie Stoehr: I mean, I don't want the bell museum to be like

160
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:56.790
Valerie Stoehr: You know, I kind of like, I mean, there is something beautiful about starting with the field notes.

161
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:03.630
Valerie Stoehr: But I agree with you to like, it's like, what the fuck, I can't even read this, you know,

162
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.030
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, um,

163
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:16.110
Valerie Stoehr: I think, yeah, leave it like this and just see how that goes. I mean, I do this seems like this is a lot better just

164
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:16.590
Valerie Stoehr: Like

165
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:22.560
mctavish: The turnout on and then it turns out, and then it says just turn off sound. You know, it's like okay

166
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:23.640
mctavish: I give up.

167
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:34.830
mctavish: Because I what I kind of thought, too, is that, you know, it's really a little bit. I just think for accessibility reasons to it's always like you have an A, you have an anchor tag.

168
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:35.700
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

169
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.310
mctavish: And what you want this, the screen reader to read is in the anchor tag like no extra you know it's just that's the simplest where there's text.

170
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.530
mctavish: The screen reader to read

171
00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:56.400
mctavish: The anchor tag. Like why struggle with that. You know, so that's what i. And so even with those links that are pointing up then down below.

172
00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:00.060
mctavish: Yeah, like it's better, actually, to say that we're top

173
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.900
mctavish: Yeah, so I might do that everywhere.

174
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.130
mctavish: Maybe not as much

175
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:06.600
Valerie Stoehr: They are, yeah.

176
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:07.410
You know,

177
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:15.270
mctavish: But so here I think it's just a little bit clearer and it doesn't matter anyway. That's her text.

178
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:29.070
mctavish: Yeah, maybe in some of the really busy or crazy tunes places. I'll put the word top, you know, because who cares. That's the word top is in those other ones. This one, like, it's like, I don't want that were necessary to interrupt her words.

179
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:37.920
Valerie Stoehr: You know, I do feel like top versus go to top. I'm not sure top will even makes sense to people.

180
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.680
Valerie Stoehr: Right being like, right, it'll look like what

181
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.770
mctavish: Yeah, true. So up or something or

182
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.510
Valerie Stoehr: What or leave it.

183
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.700
mctavish: Just leave it like that. Yeah, yeah.

184
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:54.390
Valerie Stoehr: I mean, cuz people because it's so clear about scribbling it's so clear about the up, down buttons.

185
00:13:54.690 --> 00:14:00.360
mctavish: Yeah and now it's not that thing about the menu being up to the upper left, you've never noticed that, you know,

186
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.650
mctavish: Hey, yeah.

187
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:11.130
Valerie Stoehr: Right, it's just less critical that like from any point in a page, you would want to go to the top. Like, that's a different pattern. Like, why try to teach it to them. It's not worth it.

188
00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:21.630
mctavish: Right. Right. Yeah, that's what I kept feeling like, what's the point like so you put it on the homepage, how you navigate and then no one will read that either, because what I noticed it's really true. No one scrolls.

189
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:26.640
mctavish: Yeah, you know, like, you know, often you get here, you're not going to scroll anymore.

190
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.410
mctavish: Yeah, so

191
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:34.470
mctavish: Yeah, so if you have, and I don't know. Is that kind of a dorky text.

192
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.120
mctavish: Basically thanks sex.

193
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.980
Valerie Stoehr: No, I don't think so. I don't think so.

194
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:51.870
mctavish: And if it's as simple as that. That's okay. Right. And then maybe underneath it all say, you know, link to portfolio site or something like that, you know, at the very bottom.

195
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:52.950
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

196
00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.210
mctavish: They want to know about me.

197
00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:55.080
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

198
00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:08.160
Valerie Stoehr: I think this is good, you know, the project was started during the summer of 2020 i mean that's in normal times that sentences and a strong during 2020 that's a strong sentence right

199
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:08.790
mctavish: Mm hmm.

200
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.580
Valerie Stoehr: You know this project was started in

201
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.370
mctavish: 1988 right

202
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.430
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, exactly. In, in, in, you know,

203
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.510
mctavish: Right, right, right.

204
00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.160
Valerie Stoehr: Number one was crystal not you know like it.

205
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:24.360
mctavish: Right, right.

206
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:29.580
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

207
00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.800
Valerie Stoehr: I think it says exactly

208
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:41.730
Valerie Stoehr: I think it's good. I don't think it's dorky, I just think, because it's not dorky because it's just simple and it's clear right it's

209
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:49.620
Valerie Stoehr: Like, it's a good solid way to start it like that just kind of has so much feeling behind it. But it's clear.

210
00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:51.300
Okay, good.

211
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:53.220
mctavish: Yeah.

212
00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.990
Valerie Stoehr: This project was started during

213
00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:58.350
mctavish: Yeah.

214
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.390
Valerie Stoehr: You know, and then yeah up evil grief resistance reflection isolation.

215
00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.070
Valerie Stoehr: I think it works.

216
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:09.300
Okay, good.

217
00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:17.850
mctavish: And then is this simple enough. Like, it's hard to get rid of all movement in a way, but because sometimes people won't go even further than here.

218
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:26.340
Valerie Stoehr: Right. Yep. This works because you can read it. It's clear that, like, this is the focus. This one is less about the stuff behind. I think it's fine.

219
00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.120
mctavish: Okay, good.

220
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.700
Valerie Stoehr: Cuz I I totally can read it.

221
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:36.360
Valerie Stoehr: I mean, I haven't checked on mobile, but you're really smart about that. It seems like it'd be the same thing i'd be clear.

222
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.830
mctavish: Yeah, I feel like increasingly I feel like why

223
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:44.850
Fight.

224
00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.340
mctavish: The web, you know,

225
00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:53.010
mctavish: Like way so photosynthesis is a new one. And if you saw that, but

226
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.800
mctavish: And then I think I'm going to do.

227
00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:10.740
mctavish: I think I'll probably do possibly one with film behind. I kind of do you feel like it's kind of a full collection. Now, in terms of, you know, I mean, I'll keep adding to it. Your time 60 but but i mean to hand it off.

228
00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.550
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

229
00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.200
mctavish: Yeah, so it kinda

230
00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:15.930
Valerie Stoehr: That's cool.

231
00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:24.990
Valerie Stoehr: That's beautiful.

232
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:35.820
mctavish: And then I need to finish out the sound you know make me kind of dis there's distinct islands of sound.

233
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:36.750
Yeah.

234
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:45.360
mctavish: So I have like

235
00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:55.740
mctavish: A couple of the partners that are all right. Yeah. So, and I had some sort of asking partners that I know first and then give it to the bell.

236
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.060
mctavish: Their goal of the release for the belt was more in January, so

237
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:01.980
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

238
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.660
Valerie Stoehr: So this is currently right

239
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.220
Valerie Stoehr: Date.

240
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.830
Valerie Stoehr: Like for the for the field notes in a way I expect the date to be not current date.

241
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:35.820
Yeah.

242
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.960
mctavish: Maybe almost started at 1938

243
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.250
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, why not.

244
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.180
Valerie Stoehr: Did they all have that current date on right

245
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:51.810
Right.

246
00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.150
Valerie Stoehr: Planets. Yeah, I mean,

247
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.640
Valerie Stoehr: Like if the date stamp is important to each one. Then maybe

248
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.650
Valerie Stoehr: Maybe this one could be. Yeah.

249
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:21.180
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

250
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.470
mctavish: Maybe randomize it at some point in the past.

251
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:32.880
Valerie Stoehr: Like here, it says 1914 and then up here and center has

252
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.800
mctavish: Done for

253
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.050
Valerie Stoehr: Us. Good. I guess you could display it.

254
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.640
Valerie Stoehr: Like for which ones is that part of the piece.

255
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:42.210
Valerie Stoehr: You know you

256
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.270
mctavish: And then from there.

257
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.520
Valerie Stoehr: I mean just height. Yeah, you can hide it for night train right

258
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.480
mctavish: Yeah right could actually have it start point

259
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:56.310
mctavish: Be

260
00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.120
mctavish: Like a few days before the last pigeon died.

261
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.710
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah. Uh huh.

262
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.420
Valerie Stoehr: Uh huh.

263
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.440
mctavish: Like in August of 1914

264
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:08.310
Uh huh.

265
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:10.050
Valerie Stoehr: Uh huh.

266
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:23.370
mctavish: And this one has a character like originally, I had this character and I don't know why, but this name was so strong, to me, like the word Pullman is the character.

267
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:24.240
mctavish: But I'm sort of

268
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:37.320
mctavish: I feel like there's complexity because the Pullman porters were all black so i i don't know why that name appeared, but it just like was so strong and so it's not that I don't know that. But I didn't mean for it to be that, you know,

269
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:45.780
mctavish: It was just like the name of the birth that kind of came up. So, but I think I'm going to change them that name now to just the writer, the passenger. So it's like this.

270
00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.130
mctavish: consistency with

271
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.930
mctavish: That other hero character.

272
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:53.160
mctavish: So I might even start with that's similar line here.

273
00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.940
Valerie Stoehr: That makes sense to me.

274
00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.570
mctavish: I think just to skip any question are

275
00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:05.790
Valerie Stoehr: You. Yeah, it's got such baggage, so to speak.

276
00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:06.360
Yeah.

277
00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.920
Valerie Stoehr: It's not bad. I know what you mean. It's

278
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:15.390
mctavish: Just by go there.

279
00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:36.300
Valerie Stoehr: Actually

280
00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.120
mctavish: So that was clear cleaner and clearer to you.

281
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.120
Valerie Stoehr: Totally, my God, it's like, I know where I am.

282
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:46.590
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, we

283
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:48.780
mctavish: I don't know why. Yeah.

284
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.420
Valerie Stoehr: They have their own flavors to them.

285
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.480
Valerie Stoehr: I love your colors. God damn. Look at that blue with that brown

286
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.000
Valerie Stoehr: I was, I kind of

287
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:06.750
Valerie Stoehr: So I was looking again at the audio and the video tags for HTML.

288
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.420
Valerie Stoehr: And the default audio player and

289
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:14.280
Valerie Stoehr: Firefox, like it was like, why is it brown that's so ugly. It's brown

290
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.180
Valerie Stoehr: And then I see that it was adjusting it based on

291
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.120
Valerie Stoehr: I put a background color.

292
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:21.720
mctavish: To

293
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:23.700
Valerie Stoehr: It, though, it's kind of had like

294
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.930
Valerie Stoehr: It seems to like kind of pick a compatible.

295
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.160
mctavish: Oh, weird. Yeah.

296
00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:33.540
Valerie Stoehr: But it made like an icky compatible choice.

297
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.110
Valerie Stoehr: And so

298
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:48.900
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah. Well, if it's gonna be brown, you know, blues, a good one. And then I noticed. Okay. Yeah. And then Chrome is doing something entirely different. So, you know, how do we get colors that kind of, you know,

299
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:56.790
Valerie Stoehr: But I'm just saying, yeah, brown, making brown be beautiful is a challenge.

300
00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:15.900
mctavish: You know, I've tried before a lot and it's turns really yellow and some people screens. It's like, it's kinda like red. And yeah, that whole warms it just and I think partly is because we're just so much more flexible about blue yeah brown can like really yellow me Yaki quick and

301
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.510
mctavish: Yeah, and say, well, and red can literally

302
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:19.230
Yeah.

303
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:21.570
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

304
00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:24.420
Valerie Stoehr: Wow.

305
00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.570
Valerie Stoehr: It's beautiful, it's mesmerizing.

306
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:45.960
mctavish: Okay, good. Thank you. Thank you so much for all your help. And I just, it was hard to let go of the icons, just because it took work to get it to work. And then, but you know that's always a hint to like if there's if you're struggling with this navigation bar like this fucker like

307
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.940
mctavish: Mm Hmm, maybe

308
00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.640
Valerie Stoehr: They may come back later somewhere, somehow.

309
00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.340
Valerie Stoehr: But, but why, in a way.

310
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:54.630
mctavish: Why not, I mean,

311
00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.820
Valerie Stoehr: In some other reimagined you know

312
00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.080
mctavish: Yeah, exactly.

313
00:23:58.350 --> 00:23:59.700
mctavish: Yeah, like

314
00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:09.510
mctavish: Like there's this thing about like I'm interested in working with hypertext I'm interested in really linking these documents, a lot more and and just linking in general that whole card catalog. The index the

315
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.480
mctavish: Yeah. The beautiful thing about hypertext so why

316
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:17.670
mctavish: Not use tax you know i mean that's the point of paper text right

317
00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:32.460
mctavish: You know we do all those weird that I mean for a while right it is pictures for the buttons or, you know, it's just insane with I remember like really early on, like web Native people would always just go, you know, they're like, oh yeah, that's a link

318
00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:38.460
mctavish: But then for a few other people that were used to Microsoft like access and something had to have that I agree. Great button.

319
00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.440
To click on something.

320
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:45.120
mctavish: And I just feel like there's something so beautiful about that you could click on text.

321
00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:45.900
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

322
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.820
mctavish: Right. That's the magic spell right

323
00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.020
And

324
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:52.530
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

325
00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.450
Valerie Stoehr: It's really, it's nice. I like the pace of the movements now.

326
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.470
mctavish: Oh, good.

327
00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:06.660
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, that's beautiful.

328
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.180
Valerie Stoehr: Fantastic blues.

329
00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.700
Valerie Stoehr: And the browns.

330
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.110
Valerie Stoehr: And the great helps. It's really nice.

331
00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:18.750
mctavish: Thank you. Thank you so much for helping me

332
00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:24.810
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah yeah yeah yeah

333
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:38.520
mctavish: It's rude to me, too, is because this has a little bit of all passed the on them. It's just, it's black. Actually, but whatever lies over it kind of takes the color, just a little bit, you know, so tense it slightly so it doesn't seem like this hard black thing but

334
00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.840
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, it's true. It's kind of got yeah like right now.

335
00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.170
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, that's really cool.

336
00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:48.660
mctavish: So,

337
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.870
Valerie Stoehr: Have that like purposely seen

338
00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:55.530
Valerie Stoehr: Awesome.

339
00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.810
mctavish: Thank you very much.

340
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:03.150
Valerie Stoehr: That's great.

341
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.990
Valerie Stoehr: Okay, so

342
00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.770
Valerie Stoehr: Our talks, they're helping me so much.

343
00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.870
Valerie Stoehr: Good, so

344
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.000
Valerie Stoehr: In a way, in a way, I made

345
00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:24.300
Valerie Stoehr: Like I did what I wanted to do. I got that guide damn video uploaded.

346
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.930
mctavish: By the way, and you may want to, like, just like

347
00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:33.630
mctavish: Click this often and get and and and share your screen or do you are you going to share me. Okay.

348
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.780
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah okay, actually. And let's see, I will

349
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.210
Valerie Stoehr: I'll share what I have

350
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:52.200
Valerie Stoehr: So the point is kind of not exactly what we're looking at. But the point is what I did.

351
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:54.990
Valerie Stoehr: Share screen.

352
00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:58.500
Valerie Stoehr: Share

353
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.060
Valerie Stoehr: Let's see.

354
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.010
Valerie Stoehr: Okay.

355
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:03.750
Valerie Stoehr: So,

356
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:12.180
Valerie Stoehr: That fucking hideous brown actually springing up in Chrome and stop the share

357
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:16.590
Valerie Stoehr: Screen.

358
00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.480
Valerie Stoehr: Actually maybe here. I'll send it to you.

359
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:53.010
Valerie Stoehr: So I put it in the chat and you can bring it up in I eat a C brown

360
00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.480
Valerie Stoehr: Or in Chrome to see, I think, a different

361
00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:02.820
mctavish: Yeah, yeah. It's just like a waiter in Chrome. Yeah, kind of a gray. Wait.

362
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:07.020
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah. And then when you start playing the audio.

363
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:14.130
Valerie Stoehr: The border like in Chrome, the fucking black border.

364
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:20.250
Valerie Stoehr: Show you know I modified, you know, the border property. It's like, Well, fuck you.

365
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:22.110
Valerie Stoehr: Know,

366
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:24.570
mctavish: Yeah.

367
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:36.750
Valerie Stoehr: I think maybe Firefox doesn't have that problem. I think when you play it. You don't see kind of the ghost remain and the rectangle

368
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:38.880
mctavish: It's interesting.

369
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:39.900
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

370
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.180
mctavish: So let's include the Clichy thing as

371
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.680
mctavish: It sees that whole box is a clickable.

372
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.120
mctavish: As the key indicators something

373
00:28:52.740 --> 00:29:09.210
Valerie Stoehr: What I did is I pulled so. So after we spoke like I figured out how to, you know how to fuck to I upload. You know, this file so that I can have a website, you know, and kind of do all that. Right. The problem I was struggling with

374
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:09.930
mctavish: Uh huh.

375
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:18.960
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, I was able to upload it to Blue House. Yay, you know, play it in the player. Yay. So, like, if you click Module one

376
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:21.300
Valerie Stoehr: Then you can see

377
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.170
Valerie Stoehr: That's kind of like demonstrating that

378
00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:44.280
Valerie Stoehr: And you know so yay. And then I and so like I did that. And then I'm like, Okay, I, I think I may have told you some of this in email or I can't remember what but it was like, yeah. Where the fuck did I host this thing. Like how do I

379
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:51.780
Valerie Stoehr: Even get to the middle. How do I set this thing up. I couldn't remember just some basic stuff right

380
00:29:51.960 --> 00:30:09.570
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, I'm because I'm not working in HTML and CSS. Right. So, like, how do I just set up this little structure again. And so like I went to some of my old code pens. That's where I had that kind of that modified player that I showed on the homepage.

381
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:21.300
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, drop that in. You know, dropped in module one, and then Module two is largely copied from where I am in my class right now.

382
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:28.110
Valerie Stoehr: That I'm kind of working on getting through. It's kind of like work in progress and

383
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.260
Valerie Stoehr: It's like walking through molasses to kind of

384
00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:33.630
Valerie Stoehr: You know what we're gonna do is

385
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:41.970
Valerie Stoehr: Have a pain on the right hand side that shows the transcript and then we'll be able to click, you know, which we want to go to

386
00:30:42.240 --> 00:31:01.800
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah video and you know so I still don't have like a I want to write a VTT file of my own so that I could caption that that video that I made and kind of just do some stuff with it and have multiple tracks like maybe one that is subtitles one that's just narrative one that's

387
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:03.390
Valerie Stoehr: A major language.

388
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:13.020
Valerie Stoehr: You know, um, so I'm not done with that but but I just kind of took time out and I

389
00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:29.490
Valerie Stoehr: Like, okay, so I work in Sublime Text and I go back to that Visual Studio code. Code studio, whatever the hell it is. Yeah. I mean code pans are nice because you don't have to think and you just have your different pens and you can kind of see

390
00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:40.860
Valerie Stoehr: But then, and the sublime text is nice because it's self contained, like you were saying, but also I kind of like forgotten how to set up a site right

391
00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:53.370
Valerie Stoehr: And so like my our in our afternoon indivisible group the coordinator stepping down after four years I was looking for someone else to to host it

392
00:31:55.170 --> 00:32:04.140
Valerie Stoehr: Now we're talking about getting off Facebook. We don't have a website and I thought, Well, I, you know, maybe I should put together a website for them.

393
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:04.830
Yeah.

394
00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:21.780
Valerie Stoehr: You know, and then it's good for me to think, you know, larger than a single page right to just think about how I'm like, how does that you know the right way to so um so that's kind of why like I basically just stepped back for a couple days.

395
00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:22.560
mctavish: Mm hmm.

396
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:37.590
Valerie Stoehr: You know, did the exercise of going back to supplying text kind of writing my pages there, but then setting up you know the CSS directory in a JavaScript directory and pointing to a file and just kind of, you know,

397
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.620
Valerie Stoehr: The one on one type of stuff to just, yeah.

398
00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:41.190
mctavish: Yeah.

399
00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:52.980
Valerie Stoehr: You know, and it has been a pain in the ass about I was updating on my local system and then pushing it up to blue host and then something would be wrong.

400
00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:59.220
Valerie Stoehr: You know and like going back there. Upload. Upload. And then I just start working on blue host right just directly edit.

401
00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.810
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, right.

402
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:08.250
Valerie Stoehr: It UPDATE. UPDATE, AND THEN. Okay, remember to what download everything to, you know, it's like, where's my master thing.

403
00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:14.700
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, and I still feel like I'm on GitHub. You can actually host from there right for the

404
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.450
mctavish: Simple stuff.

405
00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:16.950
mctavish: In doing. Yeah.

406
00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:32.670
Valerie Stoehr: So maybe I feel like maybe that is the answer, because I kind of just want to be able to work on my stuff and just iterate, iterate. You know, I have to like refresh after my smallest changes because I can fuck stuff so easily. Right.

407
00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:33.930
mctavish: Sure, yeah.

408
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.040
Valerie Stoehr: Um,

409
00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:38.220
mctavish: And you can see it locally. Right. You know that, right, I mean,

410
00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:39.480
Valerie Stoehr: Although some

411
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:42.060
mctavish: Like it's absolutely awesome idea.

412
00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:44.430
Valerie Stoehr: It wasn't I was having

413
00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.370
Valerie Stoehr: Issues. Yeah, probably. Cuz I didn't

414
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.300
Valerie Stoehr: I guess probably just because of being multimedia

415
00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:53.940
Valerie Stoehr: Um,

416
00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:59.130
Valerie Stoehr: Although yeah maybe if I go back to that now that things are more coherent.

417
00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:09.090
Valerie Stoehr: And I have my like I think sometimes, there was a pointing my directory structures, maybe, maybe I pointed to the wrong file and I just got so frustrated. That's why just like

418
00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:19.620
Valerie Stoehr: Went up to the actual, you know, let me just not have to translate from what's local and not working, versus what's really not working.

419
00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:25.050
mctavish: Yeah. And if you have like relative links to everything right. I mean, so

420
00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:33.540
mctavish: Like go down a directory and then into the CSS. So if everything's a relative link, you should be able to just double click on a file, and it comes up in

421
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:43.260
mctavish: Chrome or whatever. But whatever your default browser is of end. But then there is something though with like I run like a when I'm testing my stuff because it has to load.

422
00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:53.160
mctavish: Cores restrictive things right. So it has to reload these sounds behind the scenes. It has to do an AJAX call, you know, so it's pulling it it's fetching files and

423
00:34:53.460 --> 00:35:03.300
mctavish: And transcoding the buffer. And so it's actually doing that. And that's a chorus problem, right. So it's like, so all of a sudden, there's a security issue that when I do that, but if I just call

424
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:15.660
mctavish: Like an audio file, like on star fall. I'm just calling I'm calling way out of domain, but because I'm calling it just within an audio or a videotape. No problem.

425
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:30.870
mctavish: Okay. Does that sound like that for some reason the browser sees that as a sandbox, you know, I mean, it would have a problem, though, if it's like HTTPS calling HTTP, then sometimes it's like boom. Do you realize you can cross the security thing, you know.

426
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.710
mctavish: But if you're, if you call HTTP nuclear file.

427
00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:36.390
mctavish: HTTP. You don't mean so if you

428
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.460
mctavish: You know, and if you're doing relative files. You don't know that sort of transparency, you in a way

429
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:50.370
mctavish: Yeah, so you should be able to, I think, for what you're doing. So far, I can't see where you've done a chorus thing, you know, so

430
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.290
mctavish: You're just using HTML.

431
00:35:53.310 --> 00:36:02.310
mctavish: Tags. You know, you're using some of those things alone without so you should be able to do it without running a server.

432
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.510
mctavish: Uh huh. It's an easy thing to run a server, but it's just not easy.

433
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.900
mctavish: Easy.

434
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:20.100
mctavish: You know, so, so, so that is like, and he but I think in supplying text. I'm surprised. I'm wondering if you could just like upload from Sublime Text to blue host. I haven't done that I, you know, but it seems like you might be able to

435
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:20.880
Oh,

436
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:34.320
Valerie Stoehr: And also in Sublime Text. So I googled and I download like install the packages and there's a package that lets you just do what Control Alt

437
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:50.940
Valerie Stoehr: See to the wedding Chrome, but it seems like from what I can tell you, just like pick one, you can't you can't you can't view and multiple browsers, you just select which, in which browser, you want to view it.

438
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:53.940
mctavish: So three or four which one I'm saying

439
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.070
Valerie Stoehr: Or Sublime Text.

440
00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:57.270
Oh,

441
00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:05.520
mctavish: Yeah, like if I usually what I do is I have like this is maybe stupid, but I just haven't my direct you know my file directory open

442
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:15.510
mctavish: Yeah, so if I want to check on Firefox. I just write the file to Firefox and drag it to the safari. So I just like drag it over there, you know, just a. Should I just put it on top of the icon and then

443
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:20.940
mctavish: And for you right click and say open with, you know, and another browser.

444
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:21.840
Valerie Stoehr: Okay.

445
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:33.840
mctavish: So I never really work. I use some blind text only as a thumbnail pencil. It's like, you know, just with pretty calorie. Yes. A like I never, you know, so it has so much power that I never use

446
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:34.590
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

447
00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:51.210
mctavish: You know so and I in fact I don't really like when I was first a programmer. I did so much more in the console with them using like sadden graph like to interview to find and replace stuff and it was so much smarter, and now I feel like I'm often struggling with

448
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:55.350
mctavish: Sublime Text to do find and replace in a way that I

449
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.540
mctavish: Yeah, like, you know,

450
00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.940
Valerie Stoehr: Did you get a license copy

451
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:03.660
mctavish: Know I should probably does like

452
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:07.260
Valerie Stoehr: What is that your main thing that you use for

453
00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.730
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah yeah

454
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:26.040
Valerie Stoehr: I mean, and the Microsoft, whatever it is. Visual Studio code. Code studio, whatever, whatever, whatever, is that just because it has like kind of that corporate vibe, or is there more like I used it when I did my other classes. It was fine, you know,

455
00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:32.160
mctavish: Yeah, I just feel like it's sort of more. I always hate like I just always hated ideas like I just hate

456
00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:38.490
mctavish: Really like this this weight all around me like kind of restricting how I test and high

457
00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.330
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

458
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:40.650
mctavish: And I guess.

459
00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:42.090
mctavish: They could maybe

460
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:46.290
Valerie Stoehr: As a code editor, though. Like, it kind of feels like

461
00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:53.040
mctavish: Yeah, exactly. You're probably right. You're probably totally right. And I guess. Yeah, I just have always

462
00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:07.020
mctavish: Yeah, no, I think you're probably right. And then you have the FTP built in, and like I think that probably you could Google Sublime Text and FTP and directly to blue host figure out

463
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.620
mctavish: A way.

464
00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:17.910
mctavish: To do that, but, um, but, but then like probably the Microsoft product is just set up to do that, like, Well, where do you host, you know, where do you send this code, you know,

465
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:21.900
Valerie Stoehr: And plus, I might not even stay there.

466
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.630
Valerie Stoehr: You know, it's kind of more WordPress thought

467
00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:25.410
Valerie Stoehr: Thing and

468
00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:30.300
Valerie Stoehr: To make money. I should, you know, like maybe, you know,

469
00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:32.520
Valerie Stoehr: Maybe I'll

470
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:35.820
Valerie Stoehr: Some sites with WordPress or something like that. Well, I might as well.

471
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:42.210
Valerie Stoehr: I could have something there. But, but, yeah, I just wanted to easily be able to jump anywhere.

472
00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:54.900
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, well, and then for validating the code. I'm all I have been using. I mean, usually I don't look right. I just like keep checking on my change out late

473
00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:05.130
Valerie Stoehr: But there was something I like, why the fuck, isn't this working. So there's some like W three C has some validator

474
00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:16.830
Valerie Stoehr: So then instead of pointing to my. It's like, I don't know where this you know what file I have where I think this is just local right now. So just to copy all and just dump it into the

475
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:35.520
Valerie Stoehr: Whole thing and then validate. Oh, okay. But then I kind of spent, you know, a minute, maybe trying to figure out what there's kind of like a validator built into Sublime Text right but I couldn't is there. I couldn't find a way to just do it from there.

476
00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:48.840
mctavish: You know, I, yeah, I think. I mean, I think that was Sublime Text like again. It's like I do the same as you. It's like I and then if I want to troubleshoot something I throw in ways that I want to troubleshoot it

477
00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.170
Valerie Stoehr: You know,

478
00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:55.980
mctavish: So, and I don't usually I think because I'm a really bad typist I don't tend to write bad code.

479
00:40:56.310 --> 00:41:00.840
mctavish: Yeah. Um, so, I noticed, like I've seen people other people's workflow, where they have like

480
00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:14.100
mctavish: Which isn't to say this used to be mine. Maybe, but like where there's like hundreds of errors or something, you know, you go through, you know, and, and it just doesn't that doesn't really happen for me. So, and it's usually so clear where

481
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.640
Valerie Stoehr: Me.

482
00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:18.180
mctavish: A problem. You know, we, I just forgot

483
00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.010
mctavish: Yeah, embrace you know

484
00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.380
mctavish: Yeah, so I try to

485
00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:32.760
mctavish: And that's so stupid like that's what would make me look really stupid though if I went to get a development job that's precisely the thing that would make me look like a complete moron.

486
00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.460
mctavish: In fact, I wouldn't get past the interviewer, you know,

487
00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:40.410
mctavish: So,

488
00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:45.270
mctavish: But Sublime Text is more. I think it has more of a theory that you'll add

489
00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:52.890
mctavish: You can add utilities to it, right. Like, you can add you know different libraries or tools to it.

490
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:58.920
mctavish: Yeah, so it's like a bare bones thing that you add things to it. Whereas the, you know, like the Microsoft products more like

491
00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.530
mctavish: Here they. Yeah, exactly.

492
00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:12.360
mctavish: Yeah. And so, but that's really useful. And if you're comfortable with it. Yeah, go for it. Like, I'm just crabby about it, you know, and I don't you know it has that's completely legitimate.

493
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:12.990
Valerie Stoehr: You know, yeah.

494
00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:23.400
Valerie Stoehr: But exactly, but I'll, I'll just kind of keep figuring out my way with that. I mean, you're right. Like that idiot

495
00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:25.290
Valerie Stoehr: Man who we have

496
00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:33.540
Valerie Stoehr: To deal with, like, I, I, both in person and like on calls to like when they have to code.

497
00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:34.260
Valerie Stoehr: Like it's

498
00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:40.530
Valerie Stoehr: Our. This guy isn't even really coding, exactly, but they both, you know that manic wait like they just don't

499
00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.390
mctavish: Yeah, exactly.

500
00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:47.220
Valerie Stoehr: Do you like what, and then with us right we're like, oh,

501
00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:57.180
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah border bottom equals 20 PX and then save you know refresh. Yeah, that's right. And then

502
00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:58.560
Valerie Stoehr: Get it right

503
00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.830
Valerie Stoehr: And they just like do this like crash.

504
00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:03.720
mctavish: Of Shia yeah yeah

505
00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.620
Valerie Stoehr: And like if I have lots of errors. It'll be like six of them, you know,

506
00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:08.490
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

507
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:11.070
Valerie Stoehr: Oh my goddess six problems.

508
00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.110
mctavish: Yeah, right.

509
00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:19.890
mctavish: Right, because it's like you're doing more of that work in your head. I know that because that that one job I had in New York. You know, and I was working with my brother and

510
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:20.430
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

511
00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:25.710
mctavish: I felt like such a moron. Thanks to this, Bob. His name was Bob Bushman, you know, and he was just

512
00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:33.480
mctavish: And we are like me and there was this guy from India and a guy from, like, two guys from India.

513
00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:42.240
mctavish: That were in there like one guy was the database. And they were so sweet. Like they brought me to go look. Get, get some food together. You know, they ordered for me like they were so

514
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:56.490
mctavish: Like brothers, you know, and one was had an arranged marriage that he was like he was emailing back and forth to her, they're just getting to know each other. It was so sweet. They're playing, but it was really sweet actually better than Americans date, you know,

515
00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:59.220
mctavish: And

516
00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:11.580
mctavish: Yeah, and then like so Bob Bushman is like I've done thousands and thousands of lines of code. And I think I've approached managers, because he's like

517
00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.610
mctavish: Like he's just like, that's not the goal.

518
00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:15.270
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

519
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:17.850
mctavish: And realize what He's such an idiot, because he was like

520
00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:20.220
mctavish: I was like,

521
00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.230
Valerie Stoehr: Yes.

522
00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:27.330
mctavish: But then when he was fired. Actually, the and I took over the projects.

523
00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:34.200
mctavish: Like the Indian guy like they were so sweet, because they were just like they just believe me.

524
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:45.630
mctavish: Yeah, and it was just like such a different way of being badly or something. It was just like so. But I think that's just it. You will not get it, you know. But then, so I think the best like for both of us. It's like we have to think

525
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.480
mctavish: That that's not the goal.

526
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:49.410
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

527
00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:50.940
mctavish: Cuz I don't think you'll get that time.

528
00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:51.870
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

529
00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.480
Valerie Stoehr: You know. Mm hmm.

530
00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.310
mctavish: And I don't think all the time.

531
00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.210
Valerie Stoehr: Uh huh.

532
00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:00.330
mctavish: And I have a lot of experience, but I'm not going to get a job.

533
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:08.670
mctavish: So, but it doesn't. So, so I think that and what's the other thing, and then I think the other thing is absolutely

534
00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:14.100
mctavish: At every like the ends, dude. I mean, like the means

535
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:21.990
mctavish: Are the thing first, and then the end so like it because if you set up the means that's the science centric way of thinking, then

536
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:32.010
mctavish: I think at every point that's going to be what it was like my stuff. It's like not I make the shit is like no one wants to hear me to do their commercial website.

537
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:32.580
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

538
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.790
mctavish: You know, like when I tried that. Like they hate what I do.

539
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:37.290
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah yeah

540
00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:41.310
mctavish: It doesn't look like, what can it look like Amazon. You know, it's like, it will not, you know, so

541
00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:41.940
Yeah.

542
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:48.150
mctavish: My sister just asked if I could help her with her, you know, if I wanted the job of doing her

543
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:56.370
mctavish: Squarespace thing and I could figure it out. I can do it. But it's like I just have come to realize that it's not the same skill set.

544
00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:06.990
mctavish: Right. So if you're trying. And I think that your skill is probably more in thinking excessively and the thing about thinking excessively is that at every point in the process. It's simple.

545
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:09.780
mctavish: If it's not accessible to you.

546
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:13.140
mctavish: At the get go. It's probably not accessible.

547
00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:15.270
mctavish: At the end, you know,

548
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:18.870
mctavish: So that's why I keep thinking I keep so for me I think that

549
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:24.150
mctavish: Being kind of stumble but ideas. It's like forced me into this style of working that

550
00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:26.520
mctavish: Being a really bad type us to

551
00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.120
mctavish: Means that I copy and paste, which means I'm seeing patterns.

552
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:32.910
mctavish: Yeah, it's that same thing over and over again don't know

553
00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.930
mctavish: Yeah. So I think, I think that's probably so I think it's the thing

554
00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:49.140
mctavish: I think that I would, at this point, because it's not like someone's sitting waiting for you to get the fuck ready to start producing commercial things you have two weeks.

555
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:55.260
mctavish: You know, because they're not doing that, like, then I think it's like well at every point, where are you attracted to.

556
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:55.980
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

557
00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:59.340
mctavish: So don't try to do it because you think it'd be faster than it

558
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:15.450
mctavish: Is you can figure it out easier. But what do you like to do. And if you really like get up, then I would start I would take those rabbit holes in a way. Yeah, and watch get her videos to learn how it works, because it's not easy.

559
00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:19.500
mctavish: Yeah, but once you get it. You don't have to learn all of it.

560
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:29.310
mctavish: But it's a useful tool and a lot of people use it. So if that's something that's attractive to you do that if it's something else that's attractive you like the Microsoft I me

561
00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:35.460
mctavish: Fine, lot of people do. Microsoft is a really like I have a one of my dearest

562
00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:40.590
mctavish: My favorite developers that I've ever worked with went to work for Microsoft

563
00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:42.360
mctavish: He's always loved Microsoft

564
00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:48.000
mctavish: Products and I love him. I love his he's our tribe.

565
00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:49.680
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

566
00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:51.090
mctavish: You know, so

567
00:47:52.290 --> 00:48:04.050
Valerie Stoehr: I mean, I'm not even sure if that's what I want. But I remember I wasn't, I wasn't expected to be grossed out when I installed it because the course recommended you can use this through this through this and like, oh, it's free.

568
00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:05.100
Valerie Stoehr: I'll do it.

569
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.340
Valerie Stoehr: It's probably, you know, I'll probably get grossed out. Oh.

570
00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.310
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, and

571
00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:15.870
Valerie Stoehr: When I bought my Microsoft Surface

572
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.340
mctavish: Laptop after

573
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:19.590
Valerie Stoehr: You know, it's like, actually.

574
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:28.200
Valerie Stoehr: This is better than like those other windows laptops that are gross like Microsoft is very late to the game.

575
00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:34.410
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, but they're figuring out some stuff about how when you're this you know behemoth

576
00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:42.150
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, everything's kind of in this beautiful clear functional way like they're kind of get it.

577
00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:45.870
mctavish: Or yeah, exactly. I think that's true. And so

578
00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:50.790
mctavish: Yeah, so I think it's like what you like.

579
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:59.340
mctavish: Yeah. Then, and you can change later but I'm just saying at every point that should be the first question is, do I feel good here. And if you look right here.

580
00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:00.840
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, you know,

581
00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:16.170
mctavish: And it's not getting in your way, like that. I think that's really a good thing. There's nothing wrong with blue host like because the fact about blue host is it's just the same everywhere. You know, maybe that's not the thing to figure out the second

582
00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:18.660
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah yeah

583
00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.190
mctavish: And they're pretty cheap.

584
00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:22.320
Valerie Stoehr: I

585
00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:24.210
Valerie Stoehr: Go ahead.

586
00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:27.510
mctavish: I mean they're cheap. They're affordable. Right. I mean, sounds like it's it's

587
00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:28.560
Right.

588
00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:30.900
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

589
00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:43.740
Valerie Stoehr: Um, so, like what I'm really happy about is that, so in this process of, like, you know, getting yeah like a couple more pages on blue host and

590
00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.720
Valerie Stoehr: Open up the see panel and

591
00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:55.170
Valerie Stoehr: Like, why am I getting the certificate error problem when I've when it's installed on all the sites like what the fuck is going on, you know, how do we navigate all this

592
00:49:56.310 --> 00:50:08.460
Valerie Stoehr: And then with trying to just do some, you know, like modify the audio tag. And like I was, I don't have my my menu doesn't change to be a hamburger when it's small, but I've kind of got

593
00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:18.930
Valerie Stoehr: The navigation links up there and try to do some stuff and then like I want to turn off the default underlining of links so it doesn't compete with the

594
00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:29.820
Valerie Stoehr: System underlying that like, how do I do that. And so with all my Googling and you know going to all these answers. Now, I just, I feel like like I did like

595
00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:32.250
Valerie Stoehr: You know, I can look at the sample.

596
00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:35.460
Valerie Stoehr: You know, I can just be part of that conversation right like people are

597
00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:49.110
Valerie Stoehr: Having problems I'm having there's answers that include JavaScript ship and I can look at it and go, fun not touching that with a 10 foot pole or I can go all right that's. Oh, right. That's elegant shirt like

598
00:50:49.650 --> 00:51:03.240
Valerie Stoehr: I just couldn't be part of that before it was kind of all Greek to me and now you're like that that thing I wanted where I felt like all those computer science boys, you know, had that private secret.

599
00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:07.620
Valerie Stoehr: Curriculum in the room that I never got to be part of. I feel like I was in there too.

600
00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.780
Valerie Stoehr: Like I know enough

601
00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:10.320
mctavish: Yeah.

602
00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:18.750
Valerie Stoehr: You know, I'm like okay yeah I don't know how to do this thing. Okay, let me try to see if I can do that. No, I'd rather not. Thank you.

603
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:21.660
Valerie Stoehr: It's just not worth it to me now.

604
00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:35.070
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, got other priorities. I just my confidence, just like what route. You know, I don't feel like some cheater imposter anymore. And it's it's really good, you know,

605
00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:49.020
Valerie Stoehr: And I am um you know like in my class even like even taking time to do this site like before it just felt like with the JavaScript thing like just fucking get through it fucking get through it fucking get through it.

606
00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:57.390
Valerie Stoehr: You know, and now I feel like, okay, slow down, because I want to be able to like I like being able to see the old pens that I did.

607
00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:17.250
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, or and kind of having, you know, like their shit like, Oh, I did do all those like pseudo classes for CSS with the hover today. I remember anything about that. And a lot of that I didn't save. I didn't create pans. I didn't do anything. And so it's like okay you know now, I kind of know

608
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:35.340
Valerie Stoehr: What I don't care about you know what it might be important to save his documents, you know, and to just think about my work process going forward and our conversation last week about, you know, what do I want to get done. Next year, you know, how do I kind of start

609
00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:43.020
Valerie Stoehr: Building artifacts, but also just by process right like where am I working. Where's my goddamn scratch pad, you know, where

610
00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:50.970
Valerie Stoehr: Re things. I don't know that yet. Yeah, but it's worthwhile to figure that out.

611
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:59.070
Valerie Stoehr: You know, yeah. So it's just been really, really, it's been really good and and I'm also

612
00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:01.770
Valerie Stoehr: Kind of very much

613
00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:12.000
Valerie Stoehr: I mean, struggling with, but not really just grappling with. But not really, but just kind of swimming in that place of, like, what am I doing

614
00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:15.900
Valerie Stoehr: Like, who am I, what am I doing

615
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.680
Yeah.

616
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:22.110
Valerie Stoehr: You know, what do I want to become right now like which biography

617
00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:23.610
mctavish: Right, right.

618
00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:30.720
Valerie Stoehr: Right. Like, I called a cousin about a zoom call that I set up for Thanksgiving. I called her on

619
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:40.500
Valerie Stoehr: Monday or Tuesday. Hey, want to do a zoom call she's like oh enough work. Can I call you back. And I thought, that's right, that's right. All my peers are at work right, I forgot like

620
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:55.290
Valerie Stoehr: You know I'm and I remember this developer who was in her early 50s. When she got laid off from my group at Thomson Reuters and and Robin felt like she may be was going to retire.

621
00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:56.790
Valerie Stoehr: You know cuz she

622
00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:02.250
Valerie Stoehr: Had enough money didn't have any kids, her husband like told her it would be fine. You know, and

623
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:15.960
Valerie Stoehr: And I checked in with her later. And she's like, like everyone she knew she was was working and and she felt so weird for her to kind of be so young, compared to

624
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:25.410
Valerie Stoehr: You know, it just felt odd to her and and and I've been thinking about her cuz still, I feel like what, fuck, I'm almost 60

625
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:31.380
Valerie Stoehr: So I am old, but, you know, but my

626
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:39.510
Valerie Stoehr: Like the Quaker retired people tend to be more older, you know, like I it's

627
00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:51.570
Valerie Stoehr: You know, I'm not hanging like with the artists, the artist group right you know with the people who are kind of doing it this other hybrid way. And so I still feel a little like

628
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:53.100
mctavish: Yeah.

629
00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:53.730
mctavish: You know, and

630
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:54.990
In between

631
00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:57.390
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah yeah

632
00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:04.380
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, and it whereas like ah I supposed to get a job. So they get a job. You guys should like, you know,

633
00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:06.060
Valerie Stoehr: And I

634
00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:14.070
Valerie Stoehr: Still that thing about like it just, I spent a couple hours doing something for work work that I said, I do. And it was like

635
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:15.240
mctavish: Yeah, I

636
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:24.180
Valerie Stoehr: hate this. I'm like, Am I a spoiled brat like surely I mean other people have full time jobs and they try to like do things like

637
00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:32.940
Valerie Stoehr: You know, maybe I could just like do work stuff on Monday. I mean, am I such a spoiled brat, because I feel like I can't even do that, you know,

638
00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:40.800
Valerie Stoehr: Cuz I don't know, I just, you know, the amount of being able to switch to other stuff had does just keep feeling

639
00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:41.190
Yes.

640
00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.860
mctavish: I know enough

641
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:57.330
Valerie Stoehr: And I know that if you know if my wise itself would talk to me right now my mind. Why is the self is like, just go, you know, go down the crazy path like just

642
00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:58.770
Valerie Stoehr: Fucking do it.

643
00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:02.160
Valerie Stoehr: But, you know, I'm just

644
00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:03.120
Yeah.

645
00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:06.210
mctavish: Yeah yeah

646
00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:09.090
mctavish: Right, right.

647
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.170
Valerie Stoehr: Like it's this time where

648
00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:25.140
Valerie Stoehr: You know so Carol's what 75, you know, do the numbers on this, you know, like when I'm 75 you know Carol's early 90s.

649
00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.130
Valerie Stoehr: You know, like

650
00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:40.170
Valerie Stoehr: The kind of like this is this is the best time for me to kind of like have that that retirement thing, you know, I'm not caregiving right now. You know, if they're also the one who is needing care.

651
00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:40.740
Valerie Stoehr: Before

652
00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:46.290
Valerie Stoehr: He didn't care you know neither one of us got her cancer diagnosis yet. You know,

653
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:48.150
Valerie Stoehr: Just

654
00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:53.040
Valerie Stoehr: That stuff can just disappear so quickly.

655
00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:57.540
Valerie Stoehr: The ability to just do the things I wanted to do.

656
00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:00.210
Valerie Stoehr: Right. No, it does feel like kind of

657
00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:10.530
Valerie Stoehr: This word it, you know, horror, horror, the opportunity to do that right now. So that's all that stuff, you know, I'm still

658
00:57:11.070 --> 00:57:11.520
Read

659
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:18.690
mctavish: It for me. Like sometimes it helps to actually watch videos of people that are doing what I'm interested in.

660
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:22.470
Valerie Stoehr: The city like like like artists.

661
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:23.190
mctavish: Like the

662
00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:33.870
mctavish: That series is great. By the way, if you want to see art. It's on PBS. You know, like an A and then just art and then 21

663
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:46.470
mctavish: Okay, there's like a whole backlog of years of our 21 episodes. You can watch. But what I think is so helpless. Their artists so sure you're not trying to become a painter or something but but it's the same idea, though, because it's like

664
00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:50.220
mctavish: Now the studio. They have the studio practice and they just

665
00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:52.110
mctavish: Completely self defined

666
00:57:53.820 --> 00:58:05.310
mctavish: And they just do this thing without and they're not always asking themselves, should I be child Punjabi. I mean, they're, they're just that we know of. Anyway, but there seems like by this time, if they're on our 20 when they've kind of

667
00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:10.080
mctavish: Hit their stride with sustenance, you know, and so

668
00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:20.160
mctavish: It's just interesting and then or I listen right watch you know biographies of other artists like because at the beginning, like, it looks like a totally bad idea.

669
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:24.960
mctavish: They didn't have enough money, they are struggling with rent with, you know,

670
00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.540
mctavish: With it, it's so

671
00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:29.730
mctavish: It's not like

672
00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:33.330
mctavish: You know. So anyway, I just think that those things helped me

673
00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:38.100
mctavish: Like feel like, okay, there's this these other people this other tribe that I can be

674
00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:39.270
mctavish: Part of

675
00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:42.930
mctavish: And they work hard.

676
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:50.640
mctavish: You know i mean they're not likely they're not laying around or so. I mean, they're working hard, but it's so self direct so you can see what that looks like.

677
00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:52.020
Valerie Stoehr: You know, yeah.

678
00:58:52.110 --> 00:59:01.590
mctavish: And and they don't know, like, a lot of times we'll see like unless like at its best ever 21 mostly it's just like, following the artists right like so you don't hear this big interviewer.

679
00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:08.310
mctavish: Voice or anything. You're just going to watch them in studio and clearly someone has asked that question because they're answering something that

680
00:59:08.790 --> 00:59:19.920
mctavish: You don't hear that person you know so and you can see that they're struggling with, they don't know, they have a new material, they're working with it. They're not sure if it's gonna work. You know, they're struggling with, you know,

681
00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:24.000
mctavish: That you know they have some iterations, they're not happy with us. You know, it's like

682
00:59:24.570 --> 00:59:29.880
mctavish: So they like that until you know so you can see that that that's still hat. That's always happening for them.

683
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:41.160
mctavish: Yeah, no, they don't know why they had an impulse to do this thing. But they're trying it, and seems like there's a structural problem with, you know, it's like they're just always figuring it out like kind of in

684
00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:52.440
mctavish: You know, it doesn't that doesn't go away. So I think that that's like, you know, in terms of knowing exactly what the job is we don't you know because it's like that's what say with them. They don't know exactly.

685
00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.380
mctavish: What the job is for the next six months, like

686
00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:56.790
mctavish: What they're making. Exactly.

687
00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:57.510
Valerie Stoehr: Well, you know,

688
00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:02.460
mctavish: They know they're feeling what they're not quite, you know, it says it's sort of interest. And I think it's

689
01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:06.120
mctavish: Helpful to see that that's this pursuit. That's this

690
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:09.750
mctavish: And that's it. There is a different kind of

691
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:14.550
mctavish: You know methodology research methodology or something that if

692
01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:25.950
mctavish: You're worried Thompson writer who has a definite endpoint that you better fit into or or even if it's like even before like it's about the thing itself. It's about like whether you fit with that with the marketing lady.

693
01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:27.540
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

694
01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:29.610
mctavish: And like to drink scotch or something.

695
01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:31.080
Valerie Stoehr: Yes, yeah.

696
01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.350
mctavish: And can talk about it a certain way for the meeting.

697
01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.570
mctavish: Yeah, so

698
01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:38.250
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

699
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:40.680
mctavish: So i but i think that

700
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:46.950
Valerie Stoehr: It looks really nice. Just like just scrolling on the art homepage to it just makes yeah

701
01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.930
mctavish: Like yeah, exactly. Yeah.

702
01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:51.120
mctavish: Exactly. I watched things all the time.

703
01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.170
mctavish: Because it helps me

704
01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:54.030
mctavish: It really helps me a lot.

705
01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:54.630
Like Trina

706
01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:58.020
mctavish: And also, it raises my bar, you know,

707
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.800
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

708
01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:04.020
mctavish: But it raises my bar, not in a way that's like when I was working my brother agreed like Fast Company and stuff.

709
01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.720
mctavish: Because I could get competitive in that sphere.

710
01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:07.650
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

711
01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:17.010
mctavish: But like, that's that, you know, reading about like arts business like I did that, you know, at, at first, and I just show that we're talking about that this morning. It's like, not what we do.

712
01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.540
mctavish: Yeah, other people do.

713
01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:23.880
mctavish: Businesses selling going to craft fairs and that's what they do.

714
01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:26.100
mctavish: Again, we're not successful with

715
01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:28.650
mctavish: Optics and selling them, you know,

716
01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:30.000
So,

717
01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:34.350
mctavish: So it's this other thing.

718
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:46.620
mctavish: You know, it's just like you're you thought, well, if I'm gonna learn how to about code, then that means I'm going to be a junior developer. That's what I would think to, you know, always be like, Well, I'm better hedge my bet. You bet. If we won't be probably so then it's something else.

719
01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:51.510
mctavish: That's a little bit more amorphous, though, so it's hard to kind of put your finger on exactly

720
01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:56.160
Valerie Stoehr: Well, that the language analogy is really helped me where I'm

721
01:01:57.270 --> 01:02:10.920
Valerie Stoehr: You know, if you go to Germany, like it or even with me with Spanish like you know like hearing it. You know, I can kind of, sort of, I mean like my skills have become dismal. But, you know, pretend they were back where I know

722
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:16.710
Valerie Stoehr: It's one thing to just be able to hear and understand it's a whole other thing to be able to speak it.

723
01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:26.130
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, so I think I'm just trying to get through this fucking JavaScript course so that I can like here, you know, see it and understand it just kind of like if I'm

724
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:31.770
Valerie Stoehr: You know, doing some accessibility work without, you know, I can look at other people's code.

725
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:33.570
Valerie Stoehr: And see what they did.

726
01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:40.380
Valerie Stoehr: I'm probably never gonna like I felt better when I copied in all that stuff from the course.

727
01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:41.400
Valerie Stoehr: You know, in that

728
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:51.720
Valerie Stoehr: Page of mine. I thought, yeah, like, just for me to be able to modify you know to understand what's going on. To be able to just kind of modify it. I don't really have to

729
01:02:52.710 --> 01:03:03.810
Valerie Stoehr: I'm never gonna like probably construct these complex you know callbacks and functions myself really that are like this involved, but just to be able to, like, oh,

730
01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:14.940
Valerie Stoehr: Someone else did that. Okay, I could just grab it, you know, make my changes, you know that. So the difference of being able to, you know, read the Latin text versus, say it.

731
01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:19.140
Valerie Stoehr: Has really been helpful. It just kind of took this burden off my shoulder.

732
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.370
mctavish: You know, yes.

733
01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:22.440
Valerie Stoehr: Good enough to hear what they're saying.

734
01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:23.190
mctavish: Mm hmm.

735
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.070
Valerie Stoehr: As it and asked where the bathroom is

736
01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:26.850
mctavish: Mm hmm.

737
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:40.560
mctavish: Well, you know, I think that the other thing too that strikes me so much about you is that I think you know what's so interesting about like that. I've talked to you about, like, yeah, and jam stack.

738
01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:48.780
mctavish: But the thing is like when you listen to people. I mean, there's so much of guys like there that are just I can't remember they. This is one guy really love him. He's just like

739
01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:58.200
mctavish: And he, but he talks about like the it's it's kind of like taking front end development back like that's the whole point of it.

740
01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:02.070
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, yeah. I mean, Chris. Chris coyer kind of talk

741
01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:03.330
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah yeah

742
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:04.020
Valerie Stoehr: Right.

743
01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:11.940
mctavish: Yeah, I like him a lot. And then there's this other guy anyway. But the thing about that. So I think that's so true.

744
01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.130
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, like we don't need you guys anymore.

745
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:21.870
mctavish: Yeah, you don't. And so, but I mean, and the thing is, like, but even more so that's like HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

746
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:26.070
mctavish: Yeah, but even more. There's the people that are CSS freaks.

747
01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:29.610
mctavish: They're like, everything should be HTML and CSS.

748
01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:33.000
mctavish: Oh I barely any JavaScript.

749
01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.830
mctavish: Mm hmm like JavaScript is only meant to do something very specialized

750
01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:38.640
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

751
01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:49.530
mctavish: You absolutely need it. But if you don't need it and don't like it like for all buttons essentially for a long time, you can just like use them navigation Lee like I protects. That's what it is.

752
01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:50.310
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

753
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:57.690
mctavish: You know, you don't have to do like I had a friend last week. She was like, like my artist friend Catherine Meyer, so she is so she

754
01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:12.780
mctavish: gave me this. She said, could you just help me with this JavaScript, you know, and it was it was completely without context you gave me this JavaScript file and it's like all jQuery. It was ugly as hell because it's that single page design thing where everything is run by JavaScript.

755
01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:24.210
mctavish: And it's And worse yet, it was all in jQuery. So it was like it wasn't even vanilla jQuery was like an old library that like from because before like browsers were so desperate.

756
01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:27.960
mctavish: Yeah, it was really helpful to have something that would abstract away.

757
01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:29.640
mctavish: Some of their quirks.

758
01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:42.660
mctavish: There was a library called jQuery that people are using for a really long time and it had like some functionality that didn't appear in vanilla JavaScript to like yes sexiest seven right so so that so it's helpful.

759
01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:46.980
mctavish: Yeah, but because like all this code got loaded with jQuery.

760
01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:58.770
mctavish: Yes, sexy SMS happen. And so then, like, then there was a style where people just put in shims. They're called like just teeny things. They're just fix, like a lot of the browsers don't do it. Just this one thing

761
01:05:59.310 --> 01:06:01.200
mctavish: And it's standardized. It's got to be the standard

762
01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:05.610
mctavish: So we're going to still use that syntax. So you can use the syntax where everyone's going

763
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.880
mctavish: Yeah, jQuery stayed with its own syntax.

764
01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:11.100
mctavish: So you're always reading in this other

765
01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:19.650
mctavish: Language, you know, like this. So it's like I just drank because it's like, well, vanilla JavaScript can do all those things. But you're using a standard

766
01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.320
mctavish: Kind of like Oracle weirdo.

767
01:06:23.010 --> 01:06:25.620
mctavish: Procedures for database stuff versus sequel.

768
01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.550
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

769
01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:35.700
mctavish: Plains sequel just winds up a good reason to deviate from playing sequel right so so jQuery with it, but it's stuck in all this old code.

770
01:06:35.850 --> 01:06:36.360
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

771
01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:37.260
So what do you do

772
01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:42.450
mctavish: Well, so I asked her, like, Well, you know, I didn't understand why are you using this thing even

773
01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:51.810
mctavish: Yeah. Yeah. And then six I thought well because she has this other project that is where she is used the end there's some some some some CSS.

774
01:06:52.320 --> 01:07:06.870
mctavish: You know, some content management thing. So, and it's like all the security stuff with the so I thought maybe there's some reason that she has to deal with this file, it's her own website and our own website is really simple. It's just a gallery.

775
01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.160
mctavish: It's just like an art.

776
01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:12.060
mctavish: I mean, it's just like an artist's website where you just want to see the pictures.

777
01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:15.090
Valerie Stoehr: And really make it to someone make it for her.

778
01:07:15.330 --> 01:07:25.110
mctavish: She had bought it. So the template and she bought it because she liked the web did her gallery. And I said, I don't even like your doubt. I mean, honestly I didn't say that, but it's like, like I feel like

779
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:37.860
mctavish: I feel mobile first wins. So it's like so, making it into this weird she likes that weird grid structure that ends up emerging and it's like, so she has all this weight, but she paid for in jQuery.

780
01:07:39.090 --> 01:07:44.550
mctavish: You know, and then like it's her images. That's our work. She's amazing artists. She's a brilliant artist.

781
01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:46.590
mctavish: But so, then

782
01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:57.390
mctavish: You know, so then I just, it just felt like some way so but she wants that grid. So it's like okay well use grid, you'll see us. That's great. If you're like really bad but but

783
01:07:57.810 --> 01:07:58.980
mctavish: To me it's like

784
01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:07.290
mctavish: Like for you, like, so what you would do simply right if you wanted to show a bunch of pictures, picture, picture, picture, picture. What's wrong with that.

785
01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:10.020
mctavish: Like what is wrong.

786
01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:15.390
Valerie Stoehr: And then just decide about the padding between them and just spend your energy on that.

787
01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:16.050
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

788
01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:27.420
mctavish: And then like so. Then all of a sudden like you go to a large screen and you have like so. Then you're like, Well, I could like expand you know better. So, but then what is that that's flex box so

789
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:33.090
mctavish: Right, but don't do more work in that like hardwired into this like that. It goes over he you know it's a

790
01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:43.860
mctavish: Right. That's a fucking dry, you know, and then it's not even modern, you know, it's, I mean I'd sort of me and certainly don't use JavaScript to do it right so

791
01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:51.210
mctavish: So, and then, then, because then it was her back button. That wasn't working. So all of this to say her back button that miraculous thing.

792
01:08:52.350 --> 01:09:05.520
mctavish: Is like single page web design meant that it think it robs that history. So you still the history object from the, from the browser. It's not like the browser does this, like, you know, what's the Back button for, you know,

793
01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:09.450
mctavish: So we fight the Back button. You better have a good reason to fight the Back button.

794
01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:13.140
mctavish: So it's, it's, like, so you you

795
01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:29.100
mctavish: Hijack them. The back button. So then you're going to have your own you. So then you get to. Okay, so I'm going to take on all the problems with back buttons like why do that. No, but they would. And then, so the history object, right, because they want that nice you know URL to show like

796
01:09:29.730 --> 01:09:32.970
mctavish: To lie to you about what you're actually where you are.

797
01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:35.400
mctavish: They want it to be like, so it feels like

798
01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:39.810
mctavish: We're actually navigate. So it feels like you're in the old school web but yeah

799
01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:47.190
mctavish: Because it's just like, it's just navigating the web because in so so causes it's so difficult. Right.

800
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:49.950
mctavish: So why do you have to do that right because you could be like

801
01:09:50.940 --> 01:10:02.790
mctavish: I mean, that's the thing about anchors right so you can just get go. Go to that section good that section. That's it. You know, it's like, you can do that for a really long time. So then all of a sudden you have a button that you want.

802
01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:07.290
mctavish: To, you know, you want to do something else at the button that's not

803
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:09.510
mctavish: With a click thing.

804
01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:10.470
mctavish: You know, so

805
01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:14.070
mctavish: And, you know, like for you, you want

806
01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:15.810
mctavish: This is

807
01:10:16.410 --> 01:10:16.860
Valerie Stoehr: Like you

808
01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:25.500
mctavish: Can't stand these native audio player. So you just want to put like a little pretty little go button. Yeah.

809
01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:34.050
Valerie Stoehr: Well, and the thing is, like, you know, knowing that behavior with the it's like, Okay, nevermind. You know, like

810
01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:38.070
Valerie Stoehr: You know, anything that kind of has that sort of complexity.

811
01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:38.910
mctavish: It's like, yeah.

812
01:10:39.150 --> 01:10:45.480
Valerie Stoehr: Pocket then i mean you know the native stuff isn't that bad and you know it's going to get better.

813
01:10:45.810 --> 01:10:54.810
mctavish: And you know you can do almost anything with CSS, like I just don't know how like so. But, you know, you can like so you know like you can style the audio.

814
01:10:55.950 --> 01:11:06.990
mctavish: Is so you know there's like you can do right it's something you can't do so. So yeah, like so. You said why fight the things you can do, right, because I because you're like okay well I just want to have my own play button. But what about what about falling

815
01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:15.660
mctavish: Oh yeah, maybe I want my own. But, you know, so, so, so, so, then yeah, then you're back to this fact that while you know the browser already thought of those things.

816
01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:24.540
mctavish: You know, so, um, so, yeah, I don't know, it's, I think, so I for me. My feeling is that your HTML, CSS.

817
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:30.210
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm. That know that yes yeah I mean that is very clear to me. Yeah.

818
01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.220
mctavish: So great.

819
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:45.840
mctavish: Yeah, there's a lot of people are shitty and CSS like it's almost like if you're a JavaScript thinker. But you know, that's like people that you did like go tues you know ENCODE, have you ever, like so, spaghetti code right where this go to is everywhere.

820
01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:53.760
mctavish: And it was like a nightmare of coding. So like people are like, that's a shitty way to code a procedural coding people

821
01:11:54.750 --> 01:12:05.250
mctavish: Like, that's why there's these other things like object oriented. You know, like this. So, so just doing everything in JavaScript means that sometimes you miss this elegant solution that is declarative.

822
01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.420
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

823
01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:14.340
mctavish: Because you're doing all this procedural stuff and jobs and but but okay. So, but there's but you believe in declarative right because that's

824
01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:24.960
mctavish: Clear the put as much semantic the information that screen readable because accessibility is probably going to end up being your strong suit.

825
01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:26.010
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

826
01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:34.230
mctavish: So you put that means that you're putting a lot and HTML itself like you're almost working in HTML to the last second.

827
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:35.130
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

828
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:38.610
mctavish: You know when you add in some CSS.

829
01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:42.120
mctavish: And then you're doing all of this stuff and CSS.

830
01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.910
mctavish: Yeah, until you have to add JavaScript.

831
01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:53.460
mctavish: Yeah. So to me it's like you're doing almost 80% of your work in HTML. Yeah, because that's where accessibility lives.

832
01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:59.790
mctavish: Yeah, like the CSS stuff. It's doesn't have anything to do with accessibility. Yes, I can help you.

833
01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.260
mctavish: You know, get more accessible.

834
01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:09.840
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, well, and one thing that happened when I copied some of my old pens in there is that I was using articles and sections and

835
01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:21.240
Valerie Stoehr: You know content, you know, blah, blah, blah. And I've liked forgotten some of that stuff. So when I saw at first with my simple little site, you know, I was trying to have like

836
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:32.370
Valerie Stoehr: Here's my content section got two articles, you know, the first article is this one video tag, you know, actually. The next one is my other video tag.

837
01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:48.090
Valerie Stoehr: Ivan the puppet. And then the one from class and then I was doing something I can't remember what I think it's what I was trying to dropping in that code from the class, then where I was making it more complex with showing the events that happened in the

838
01:13:48.780 --> 01:14:00.330
Valerie Stoehr: Key file and then yes something wasn't working. And so finally, then when I copied it all over to the validator I had some air where you can't put the

839
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:04.320
Valerie Stoehr: I don't know, you can't put something in the section tag that I had

840
01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:23.070
Valerie Stoehr: You know, I had done side broken the syntax rule. It's like, yeah, I don't remember this shit. So then I just stripped all those, you know, a hierarchy things out of it. Because like for right now. I can't really trip on that I kind of wanted it to be all beautiful and kind of have my

841
01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.700
Valerie Stoehr: You know the stuff you're supposed to put in the header and

842
01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:31.740
Valerie Stoehr: All that semantic information. I thought, well, that'd be lovely to just extend that

843
01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:41.970
Valerie Stoehr: But so that's like that place. I want to be. But I think right now like get through my multimedia stuff, you know, and I'm

844
01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:53.940
Valerie Stoehr: Gonna get it clean, clean, clean, so just out that all went live and just focus on this. And then I think when I'm done, then I go back to the stuff I've forgotten.

845
01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:56.910
Valerie Stoehr: And I get all refreshed on like God.

846
01:14:57.330 --> 01:15:02.430
Valerie Stoehr: And then I can start setting up because that's the part that

847
01:15:04.050 --> 01:15:16.830
Valerie Stoehr: Like I can see even with my three page thing I'm struggling about like I love my, you know, I want the information structure to be like really

848
01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:18.900
Valerie Stoehr: Clear and

849
01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:27.210
Valerie Stoehr: Liable so that like so should you know where my classes. And where are my ideas you know where you don't

850
01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:32.130
Valerie Stoehr: Don't throw them in. If you don't need to, you know, and keep it at, you know, to keep that all

851
01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:34.590
Valerie Stoehr: That thinking really clean right

852
01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:42.930
Valerie Stoehr: So that if I just wanted to change, you know, this player but not that player around my players. I just want to experiment on this.

853
01:15:43.230 --> 01:15:51.630
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah. Hey, or is it on this part of this page. And so again, I'm thinking, oh my god, like my CSS file just from those three pages.

854
01:15:51.870 --> 01:16:02.250
Valerie Stoehr: Like, and from carrying over pans. When I was working on that stuff right where the point was to modify the video tag and the point was to modify the audio tag right so

855
01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:15.810
Valerie Stoehr: You know, like I wouldn't normally have that in there. But now we're playing with multimedia, so why not, but I can see like how quickly that CSS files, just like what the fuck is in here.

856
01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:23.340
Valerie Stoehr: Right. You know, there's hardly any content there. Right. And so, so, you know,

857
01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:30.870
Valerie Stoehr: So that'll kind of be I think that that place to go back to that kind of dovetails with accessibility in a way

858
01:16:30.930 --> 01:16:31.890
mctavish: Yeah yeah

859
01:16:32.670 --> 01:16:36.840
Valerie Stoehr: So get refreshed on all that semantic best practice.

860
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:42.510
mctavish: Yes. Yeah, exactly. I would love to do actually like almost like a reading group about that.

861
01:16:42.810 --> 01:16:43.350
Valerie Stoehr: Uh huh.

862
01:16:43.650 --> 01:16:45.420
mctavish: You know when you're ready. Like, just to do

863
01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:58.980
mctavish: Like to like pick something and maybe it's even a book, you know, but like a CSS or three it like a really up to date. Yes, even just read through it really feel like I got the power of this I know which tool to pack.

864
01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:02.820
mctavish: And then the other end. And for me, it helps me understand the whole

865
01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:09.930
mctavish: Yeah, instead of like special case by special case, it's just like learn understand the whole of it. So you can think like that.

866
01:17:10.170 --> 01:17:10.860
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

867
01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.050
mctavish: And then, and then, like, same with

868
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:19.020
mctavish: And then learning the access to some extent that modern accessibility don't find it, you know.

869
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:35.040
mctavish: Just what is it like, how would you write a page from the get go, that and that should be what you do, like that's like if all you do is have an ugly, ugly, ugly, but semantically true like a very like it has the permission exactly laid out where you mean it.

870
01:17:36.450 --> 01:17:36.690
mctavish: Does

871
01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:42.870
Valerie Stoehr: And I think that that could be like cuz maybe I want to be able to just give that talk to somebody

872
01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:43.830
Valerie Stoehr: Right. You know, like I

873
01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:45.210
Valerie Stoehr: Put that together.

874
01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:46.110
mctavish: Yes.

875
01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.480
Valerie Stoehr: I have that as kind of

876
01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:58.440
Valerie Stoehr: You know, maybe it's something I you know it's building out that portfolio or just kind of the stuff that I feel competent doing

877
01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:08.820
Valerie Stoehr: And so, you know, I thought like, I'd be doing it simultaneously like you know my starter point was one of my old files that have that all in it, but yeah.

878
01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:09.570
mctavish: Yeah yeah

879
01:18:11.190 --> 01:18:13.200
Valerie Stoehr: That will come a little later, but that's

880
01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:18.300
mctavish: Ready, we can do it. Like if you want to just like to, like, I wanted to get just get through this media thing, you know.

881
01:18:18.330 --> 01:18:19.290
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, right.

882
01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.700
mctavish: Yeah, that makes sense to me.

883
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.420
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

884
01:18:21.870 --> 01:18:23.040
mctavish: Cuz I yeah

885
01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.400
Valerie Stoehr: That makes sense. And what's nice because I've been thinking, oh god.

886
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:35.430
Valerie Stoehr: You know I'm going to have to go back and do all that, you know, my HTML class all over again, my CSS click, but then it is like riding a bicycle. You know, like now.

887
01:18:35.490 --> 01:18:38.310
Valerie Stoehr: Right. How do I do that again. Oh yeah, right. Google

888
01:18:38.370 --> 01:18:43.410
Valerie Stoehr: Oh yeah, yeah, instead of just like everything being a mountain, you know,

889
01:18:43.650 --> 01:18:44.010
mctavish: Yeah.

890
01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:52.050
Valerie Stoehr: Kind of, Oh, I remember when we work through this. I remember when I did those pseudo classes. I remember this. Yeah, all those articles I kind of remember how that works. Sort of.

891
01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:58.560
Valerie Stoehr: I remember you can do like a side panel navigation thing and think about that being, you know, the semantic content and

892
01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:07.110
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, so I can't like remember it well enough to do it, but I know it'll, it'll just be faster to kind of go back there again.

893
01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:15.210
mctavish: And the other thing is like I think being opinionated like having a manifesto, like, it's like you said, I think it's so great. Like, if you were to write this thing at the same time as you're learning it

894
01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:18.360
mctavish: Yeah, it's like, because then you can just release a ton of stuff.

895
01:19:18.450 --> 01:19:19.920
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, yeah, no.

896
01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:27.450
mctavish: Like, just like like the all this like Java potent like before I would be like, Oh, I should do that. We should do that like about all the JavaScript potential, but it's like

897
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:38.340
mctavish: Just going to release that release that release that I've never gonna, I hate that. So, no don't want it don't believe in it. Not manifesto. And I think that's that will be true.

898
01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:49.110
mctavish: For you, right, like, there'll be because there's so many ways you can go. But then I think the thing about the CSS selectors. If you get if we read a book together. We're really into it.

899
01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:58.050
mctavish: Our of selectors and then the and cascading yes eating. Exactly. You know, they like the brilliance of cast the cast

900
01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:06.660
mctavish: Exactly and like what you don't need to say again what you do and then and now there's this brilliant thing I think about CSS variables. So you can just say this is these are my colors.

901
01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:11.070
mctavish: Yeah, just put it up the top so you don't have to keep remembering what was that coding and you know some

902
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:19.950
mctavish: Just there it is. And then you just so I think that if we did it because that was CSS is like sequel it you know it's selectors. It's like

903
01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:21.810
mctavish: A Venn diagrams, you know,

904
01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:26.970
mctavish: So it's more like sequel sequel thinking them like c++ thinking

905
01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.580
Valerie Stoehr: Yay. Yeah.

906
01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:30.270
So,

907
01:20:31.650 --> 01:20:38.370
mctavish: That's and I feel like that's the because you have this information and then all you're asking, as you're

908
01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:38.700
mctavish: Just

909
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:42.450
Valerie Stoehr: applying some. And that's why, like if you're

910
01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:49.320
Valerie Stoehr: It's design thinking right if you're smart about your structure if you smart about like what the fuck you're doing

911
01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:56.580
Valerie Stoehr: And how you're structuring it how you're thinking about what the, you know, the problem is you're trying to solve it. If you know what the hell you're doing

912
01:20:57.450 --> 01:21:07.230
Valerie Stoehr: Then the CSS code is just like there's nothing to it. Right. Oh, I just know in my, you know, in my end us you know with this class, I want to do that.

913
01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:16.500
Valerie Stoehr: And with the blah, blah, blah. You know, in the body for the list with the blah, I want to do that. That's all I want to do because I set it up in that beautiful way right

914
01:21:16.890 --> 01:21:21.600
Valerie Stoehr: articulate our 21 when I look at that, like those are the types of

915
01:21:21.690 --> 01:21:34.110
Valerie Stoehr: Like those my sites are going to look like that, you know, it's where you're syndicating information when you have articles you know you've got sections. You've got content, you know, what's their relationship to each other.

916
01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:34.920
mctavish: Yeah, right.

917
01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:38.700
Valerie Stoehr: And you just structure it that way, and then

918
01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:42.870
mctavish: You don't even have time for the CSS.

919
01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:45.960
Valerie Stoehr: Right exactly you're home free.

920
01:21:46.170 --> 01:21:49.080
Valerie Stoehr: Yes, because it's all Anna.

921
01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:56.580
Valerie Stoehr: Or just go slap in some pretty styles and decide what font you want you know like a tough one. I think should be

922
01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:58.740
Valerie Stoehr: Right, or am

923
01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:00.630
Valerie Stoehr: I yeah

924
01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:01.410
Yeah.

925
01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:05.790
mctavish: Yeah. So I think, I think that that's the way of thinking.

926
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:13.050
mctavish: Yes. And then people are just really thinking back now. They're just like, whoa, before it was so girly. But now it's like

927
01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:13.530
Yeah.

928
01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:18.120
mctavish: Yep. Don't know how to do that don't want to know how

929
01:22:18.150 --> 01:22:18.630
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

930
01:22:18.690 --> 01:22:21.630
mctavish: Yeah, it's all out to this payment thing. Yeah.

931
01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:22.560
Yep.

932
01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:31.080
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah and now it and instead of being like, I don't want to do JavaScript because I don't like I didn't understand the difference between

933
01:22:31.410 --> 01:22:46.890
Valerie Stoehr: JQuery and JavaScript. I was kind of learning that in the course and what you said was like, oh yeah, click. I get that. Okay, now like before it was just all Greek to me. Right. And so now that I know what that thing is. And it's not just a mystery.

934
01:22:47.370 --> 01:22:49.440
Valerie Stoehr: No, it feels very easy.

935
01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:59.400
Valerie Stoehr: To not go there because I kind of know what it is, instead of like, oh, I'm just so dumb. I can't. And there's this whole thing I'm missing. I'm so dumb.

936
01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:02.640
Valerie Stoehr: Like okay, I don't really

937
01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:18.330
mctavish: It doesn't even perform well so anymore. So it's all right. It's like an old thing that like if you were hired into a company and you had to slog through old code then yeah, you have to notate Corey, but you own that that might that maintenance that will never happen to you.

938
01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:19.500
Yeah.

939
01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:30.930
Valerie Stoehr: Three. Excellent.

940
01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:44.010
mctavish: Yeah, well, yeah, we should find a good yes I do find that easy. You can read anything on line right but it might be nice to actually have a book, a CSS three books.

941
01:23:45.450 --> 01:23:46.320
mctavish: Because it just

942
01:23:48.150 --> 01:23:49.230
mctavish: It was just nice to read

943
01:23:49.230 --> 01:23:53.130
mctavish: Sometimes like the whole of it, like, read it like it's a literature and, you know, like it's

944
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:56.430
Valerie Stoehr: I purchased the

945
01:23:57.750 --> 01:24:05.400
Valerie Stoehr: It's downstairs. It's not right here I purchased the forms book from like you know how smashing comes out with

946
01:24:05.490 --> 01:24:10.620
Valerie Stoehr: Them. And so I got there. But actually, I'm gonna get it. I'll be back. I'll show you something.

947
01:24:44.130 --> 01:24:46.200
Valerie Stoehr: So this is from the before times

948
01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:49.380
Valerie Stoehr: Form design patterns.

949
01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:53.160
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, and I got it, like, you know, and of

950
01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:09.630
Valerie Stoehr: Or early 2019 so it's when I was working on the early HTML, CSS classes in the series. I don't think I've quit a job yet so it's from way earlier because I didn't. And because when like when I was young.

951
01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:18.810
Valerie Stoehr: When I was in, I think, third, and fourth grade. My parents gave me a dictionary for Christmas and I had it by my bad. And just like kind of read

952
01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:37.350
Valerie Stoehr: The dictionary and then it would have rules about syntax and rules, you know, publishing and it just had like, you know, meta stuff about it. In addition to the dictionary. I just like read it. And for me, like during the day. I don't tend to read, but like in bad

953
01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:40.170
Valerie Stoehr: Like, that's right. So I put it by the bad

954
01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:41.550
Valerie Stoehr: And I thought,

955
01:25:43.650 --> 01:25:47.880
Valerie Stoehr: Because sometimes that's where I'll just read that kind of rules based stuff, you know,

956
01:25:48.270 --> 01:26:04.650
Valerie Stoehr: Yes, I'll just try to get these, like, you know, patterns, kind of like reading. So I did that for a while. It's not like I remember this ship very well. But, um, but, but what's interesting is that the the book, the physical book design sucks.

957
01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:20.970
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, so I kind of, it's you know, it's nice content. It's all about just like, don't be fancy of fucking morons. Like, you know, here's how radio buttons work don't fight it. Like, do this, don't do this. It's very

958
01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:24.510
Valerie Stoehr: You know, it's, it's good.

959
01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:46.230
Valerie Stoehr: But the physical pages like they're the way it's put together. It's just they they didn't have a book designer, it's just it's way too many pages. The white space is like all wrong. It's kind of, it's weird. It's kind of like they printed it out on a printer.

960
01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:56.340
Valerie Stoehr: And then I sent it to someone to bind it up and put a cover on it. You know, it's just proportions are like really goofy, but um

961
01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:59.280
Valerie Stoehr: But you like it.

962
01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:08.760
Valerie Stoehr: Again, not that this is current because I'm not looking at it right now and focusing on other things, but it is really helpful for me to kind of have like a

963
01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:14.820
mctavish: rule book. Same way, yep. It's like this is the this is the overview of

964
01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:16.440
mctavish: Your rules. Yeah.

965
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:17.520
mctavish: Yeah yeah

966
01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:22.800
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, there's five chapters chapter one. Yeah, one

967
01:27:23.370 --> 01:27:23.820
mctavish: Theory.

968
01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:25.260
mctavish: It's like the theory book.

969
01:27:25.290 --> 01:27:25.710
Yeah.

970
01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:32.190
mctavish: Yeah, that's what I think. So it's almost like reading like it's hard to read through like the W three seed documents, you know,

971
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.870
mctavish: I find it useful. If I could read through them. I think that would be, it's just

972
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:38.760
mctavish: Very useful because you get the theory of it.

973
01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:43.740
mctavish: Yes. And then it doesn't matter if you memorize it. It's just, but that, you know, this is

974
01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:46.230
mctavish: A Theory of what how a cascade works.

975
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:46.770
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

976
01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:47.640
You know,

977
01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:57.450
mctavish: Yeah, and then you can kind of feel like the intent, like, then that kind of way of thinking the paradigm for it.

978
01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:00.540
Yeah.

979
01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:19.290
mctavish: Alright so there'll be like a reading thing about let's let's kind of keep our eye out for something really good about accessibility. Let's. But that's the thing that's hard to get better be 2019 or, you know,

980
01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:22.080
Valerie Stoehr: Or 2020 year old and it can I know like

981
01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:24.120
Valerie Stoehr: Like right now, during my

982
01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:26.490
Valerie Stoehr: During this course, like I'm not doing it.

983
01:28:26.850 --> 01:28:29.550
mctavish: Yeah yeah yeah that makes sense.

984
01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:29.850
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

985
01:28:30.630 --> 01:28:35.190
mctavish: It's a whole. It's kind of a different way of thinking or something. But it's kind of nice to know that you're going that direction, right, because it's like

986
01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:39.150
Valerie Stoehr: Let me grow.

987
01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:47.460
Valerie Stoehr: I mentioned, like a study books for the accessibility exam.

988
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:48.270
And

989
01:28:49.710 --> 01:28:50.310
Valerie Stoehr: I'm, um,

990
01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:55.170
Valerie Stoehr: So I've got this one.

991
01:28:56.670 --> 01:28:58.170
mctavish: Did you just printed it out.

992
01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:03.750
Valerie Stoehr: I this is the, um, I became a member to be able to buy the study guides

993
01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:04.170
mctavish: Oh,

994
01:29:04.410 --> 01:29:07.020
Valerie Stoehr: For the exams and

995
01:29:09.090 --> 01:29:10.650
Valerie Stoehr: And so it's kind of what a

996
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:15.210
Valerie Stoehr: Good Table of Contents here.

997
01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:23.310
Valerie Stoehr: And this is about the Certified Professional and accessibility core competencies credential.

998
01:29:24.450 --> 01:29:45.360
Valerie Stoehr: It's their foundational certification. It represents practical application of broad cross disciplinary knowledge about number one disabilities. Number two, accessibility and universal design and three accessibility related standards laws and management strategies. So it has this

999
01:29:47.130 --> 01:29:49.020
Valerie Stoehr: Thing. You're supposed to go through

1000
01:29:57.690 --> 01:30:00.630
Valerie Stoehr: You it's backwards to me. But you can see it right. Yeah.

1001
01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:02.460
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, and then

1002
01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:05.130
Valerie Stoehr: For the table of contents.

1003
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:11.730
mctavish: How much did you pay the train that

1004
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:12.930
I'm

1005
01:30:14.490 --> 01:30:32.760
Valerie Stoehr: 200 bucks or so, like there was joining to be a member. And then there was joining on looking. Let's see it. Oh, and then there was buying this separately. I really, I think I might have paid four or $500 for the combination of two things.

1006
01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:38.970
Valerie Stoehr: And then I have this skinny one here.

1007
01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:42.420
Valerie Stoehr: Oh yeah, that was the core one the first

1008
01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:47.940
Valerie Stoehr: Test and then this is the one where you have to know. I think JavaScript and shit. This one's more technical

1009
01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:52.470
Valerie Stoehr: So here's the table of contents.

1010
01:30:58.020 --> 01:30:59.910
Valerie Stoehr: So it sort of is the rule book.

1011
01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:02.190
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, and

1012
01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:07.140
Valerie Stoehr: And I might have a digital copy and I might not, but I could

1013
01:31:09.930 --> 01:31:12.780
Valerie Stoehr: We could discuss I could possibly cheat and give you a copy

1014
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:21.000
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, anyway.

1015
01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:24.750
Valerie Stoehr: So this is kind of, you know, like they decided that

1016
01:31:25.050 --> 01:31:32.400
Valerie Stoehr: This is the shit. You should know to get that certification and so it's you know it's something right. It's not bad for a

1017
01:31:33.570 --> 01:31:34.980
Valerie Stoehr: You should know this stuff.

1018
01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:46.500
Valerie Stoehr: And that that first one you know does non digital. It does digital it. You have to know the standards, but it's things about disabilities.

1019
01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:50.280
Valerie Stoehr: Like certain

1020
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:54.390
Valerie Stoehr: Certain conditions and

1021
01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:09.450
Valerie Stoehr: I don't know, just stuff about people with Parkinson's might have this going on or, you know, there's a certain disease that does this, you know, kind of being able to identify certain things.

1022
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:20.160
Valerie Stoehr: And like saying people with disabilities, instead of disabled people, some of the, you know, just get your shit together about how you use language and

1023
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:27.480
Valerie Stoehr: So that's been sitting in my file drawer, as you know,

1024
01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:30.420
Valerie Stoehr: A possible place to go after I

1025
01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:35.100
Valerie Stoehr: Get through here. It's, um,

1026
01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:36.990
Valerie Stoehr: The place.

1027
01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:42.540
Valerie Stoehr: It's I. A. P.

1028
01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:45.090
mctavish: Dad.

1029
01:32:45.390 --> 01:32:46.320
mctavish: pulled it up. Yeah.

1030
01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:47.910
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, and then

1031
01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:55.290
Valerie Stoehr: I bought these from D qu e i think it is UK

1032
01:32:58.830 --> 01:33:04.230
Valerie Stoehr: Like if you Google on you know training stuff for the accessibility exam.

1033
01:33:04.650 --> 01:33:07.200
mctavish: Yep, I can see, see I got it, yeah.

1034
01:33:08.970 --> 01:33:09.300
mctavish: Yeah.

1035
01:33:12.570 --> 01:33:19.890
mctavish: Well, the thing about my work, too, is I know it's like it's not good for people that are want really high contrast cited things

1036
01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:25.920
mctavish: You know, so it's kind of assuming that you're going to go to a screen reader or, you know, you're going to have the sound.

1037
01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:28.890
mctavish: Yeah, it's sort of interesting because it's like

1038
01:33:30.150 --> 01:33:35.220
mctavish: You know, what do you do about it. So, but I think it's an interesting thing to play with and

1039
01:33:35.850 --> 01:33:40.950
mctavish: And I kind of like, you know, that one thing that I sent you about people that are doing all take

1040
01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:56.430
mctavish: Yeah artistry since I kind of like to into their stuff a little bit more. That's kind of like, it's not really deep, you know, but it's but at the same time. Is it is sort of interesting about they put a lot of opportunities to be able to like where they were, they record their own audio.

1041
01:33:56.730 --> 01:34:01.830
mctavish: Yeah, so, so it's kind of interesting from some of those perspectives about

1042
01:34:03.330 --> 01:34:07.140
mctavish: Like instead of having all this tax you can say, do you want to listen to a sailor.

1043
01:34:07.410 --> 01:34:07.890
mctavish: Yeah.

1044
01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:12.270
mctavish: Be that text and it's like they are boys reading it instead of a screen readers.

1045
01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:25.080
mctavish: Yeah. And then, so there's stuff like that and also with images. They're kind of talking about just a lot of the politics of all tags. Like, who does the descriptors. You know, like soap. It's

1046
01:34:26.730 --> 01:34:37.050
mctavish: Know Before there was this idea that, you know, it's kind of within an artist scenario to so like if there's images like on a music, art museums website that it was the curator, or it was someone

1047
01:34:38.130 --> 01:34:46.800
mctavish: You know, like an accessibility specialist would put these captions, you know up for the images but then that actually when it's art, you kind of like the artist has a

1048
01:34:47.850 --> 01:34:49.560
mctavish: Should have a Sam at because

1049
01:34:50.250 --> 01:34:52.530
mctavish: Their work. You know, so they have a backstory.

1050
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:56.940
mctavish: And then a lot of talking about like if you have a picture of like you write on a website.

1051
01:34:58.020 --> 01:34:59.400
mctavish: Then what does the caption say

1052
01:34:59.490 --> 01:35:04.350
mctavish: Yeah, you know, white girl that's older, you know, like, like you're. I mean, it's like so.

1053
01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:06.150
mctavish: They already kind of talking about that, like,

1054
01:35:06.210 --> 01:35:14.340
mctavish: Where, where does identity come in and like be interesting thing, like do you put in that your waiter, you're not like and and if you leave it out, like, Why did you leave it out.

1055
01:35:14.490 --> 01:35:18.420
mctavish: Yeah, you know. So stuff like that, like, you know, and about gender and about

1056
01:35:18.570 --> 01:35:23.130
mctavish: Yeah, so they had some examples of descriptions

1057
01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:23.970
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

1058
01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:26.130
mctavish: That are actually interesting.

1059
01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:28.620
mctavish: You know about the image itself, you know,

1060
01:35:29.610 --> 01:35:30.630
mctavish: And choices that

1061
01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:32.010
mctavish: To make around

1062
01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:37.380
mctavish: You know, because like if you don't care about the identity but like people do care about the, you know, so like where does that

1063
01:35:37.890 --> 01:35:38.970
mctavish: Yeah, then you know

1064
01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:46.230
Valerie Stoehr: I was reading some similar stuff when I was looking at when I was all excited about that job that pays 20 bucks an hour.

1065
01:35:46.410 --> 01:35:46.920
Valerie Stoehr: Right.

1066
01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:54.390
Valerie Stoehr: The Dallas Art Museum, you know, which I didn't do anything with. But that I read the best practices on it and

1067
01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:06.630
Valerie Stoehr: Because I hadn't thought about, like, and it was saying like, it's not a bad thing to use color like in those descriptions, which I kind of thought. I hadn't really thought

1068
01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:14.910
Valerie Stoehr: I kind of thought that was bad. It's like, no, you know, because you know people who like they lost their site later or

1069
01:36:15.930 --> 01:36:16.530
Valerie Stoehr: You know, like

1070
01:36:17.730 --> 01:36:31.050
Valerie Stoehr: They may know color like it's not to say that it's a, you know, yellow whatever indebted at it and and and it also talked about that identity stuff and you know light skinned woman with that added on.

1071
01:36:32.970 --> 01:36:33.420
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

1072
01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:35.160
mctavish: Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting.

1073
01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:37.590
mctavish: But

1074
01:36:38.970 --> 01:36:47.250
Valerie Stoehr: We can just go all out tags and 22. I mean, just like total deep dive into alt tags would be amazing, you know,

1075
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:52.710
mctavish: Yeah, I think about that, like with my, you know, with all the SVG stuff like

1076
01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.170
mctavish: Like if each of those

1077
01:36:57.090 --> 01:36:57.660
Valerie Stoehr: Right.

1078
01:36:57.810 --> 01:36:59.100
mctavish: You know objects have

1079
01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:00.690
mctavish: Night. Like, where does the LT

1080
01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:01.500
Valerie Stoehr: Go.

1081
01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:03.630
mctavish: You know, just to go on each one of those circles are

1082
01:37:03.690 --> 01:37:04.230
Valerie Stoehr: Right.

1083
01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:06.210
mctavish: You know. So is that a cacophony of

1084
01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:15.000
mctavish: Yeah, of alt tags or is it. It's probably on the SVG element itself. So it's like as if the whole thing was the image.

1085
01:37:15.090 --> 01:37:15.720
Mm hmm.

1086
01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.000
mctavish: You know, it's interesting. Like, where do you

1087
01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:20.340
mctavish: Put explanatory

1088
01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:27.930
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm. And like I can imagine that you've got all tech sound that it's not your soundtrack.

1089
01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:28.440
mctavish: Mm hmm.

1090
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:32.460
Valerie Stoehr: But your images are like sounds so like the yellow stuff, you know,

1091
01:37:34.350 --> 01:37:35.670
mctavish: Yeah yeah yeah

1092
01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:40.710
Valerie Stoehr: You know, there's a, you know, the big brown block or

1093
01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:42.690
Valerie Stoehr: And you read

1094
01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:43.770
I can

1095
01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:45.510
mctavish: Yeah.

1096
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:49.290
Valerie Stoehr: That's kind of how to convey what the page looks like, you know,

1097
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:50.520
mctavish: Right, right.

1098
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:58.590
Valerie Stoehr: You could kind of have words, you know, like, you know, a yellow triangle emerges, you know, from the top. Whoops, there

1099
01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:01.320
Valerie Stoehr: And then blue

1100
01:38:03.330 --> 01:38:07.440
Valerie Stoehr: Here you kind of like talk about all the actors coming in that have their unique

1101
01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:07.860
Brave.

1102
01:38:09.150 --> 01:38:09.600
mctavish: Right.

1103
01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:15.510
Valerie Stoehr: And let them just run around on the stage, you know, like that's what it looks like.

1104
01:38:15.930 --> 01:38:18.420
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, cool way for you to do.

1105
01:38:19.410 --> 01:38:24.900
mctavish: Yeah, yeah. I think there's just like some other thing you know that's that's still part of the work.

1106
01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:26.190
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, right.

1107
01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:28.020
mctavish: You know, like, so it's like that that you

1108
01:38:29.730 --> 01:38:31.350
mctavish: All of a sudden become all boring.

1109
01:38:32.250 --> 01:38:37.230
mctavish: City, you know, I mean, it's like we're not helping my dad read that that tech, you know, I mean, it's like there's something

1110
01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:38.130
Right.

1111
01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.080
Valerie Stoehr: I mean, like how

1112
01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:45.000
Valerie Stoehr: How would you really discover you know if someone who couldn't see

1113
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:50.460
Valerie Stoehr: Right, I wouldn't be kind of going like this when I talked about it, you know, or

1114
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:53.100
mctavish: Maybe it's not even like it's about like

1115
01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:57.090
mctavish: It's in text poetically about overwhelm

1116
01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:58.470
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah. Uh huh.

1117
01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:03.570
mctavish: Yeah, like there's just something completely non visual way of describing

1118
01:39:03.930 --> 01:39:04.470
Valerie Stoehr: Right.

1119
01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:06.210
mctavish: You know that

1120
01:39:07.290 --> 01:39:10.620
mctavish: Yeah, it's interesting. So yeah, I think accessibility is like this huge

1121
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:18.840
mctavish: nut to crack because it's also like, you know, like for a sign language interpreter, like a lot of hearing people just love. I just love watching concerts with this.

1122
01:39:19.710 --> 01:39:26.640
mctavish: Which is kind of misses the point of sign language interpreter. Right. Like, like a lot of if you're profoundly deaf, you just really don't care what concepts.

1123
01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:28.380
mctavish: Like the words aren't that great.

1124
01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:29.850
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

1125
01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:41.460
mctavish: And if you're there to see the choreography of it, then, you know, want to see the watch the interpreter, you want to watch the people that are Nancy, with their guitars and stuff, you know, like, that's where the action is happening right

1126
01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:46.590
mctavish: So you hear like like you see you have to keep going back to the interpretive see La, la, la, la, la.

1127
01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:49.020
mctavish: You know, it's like so.

1128
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:59.670
mctavish: Or watch the interpretive dance who may or may not be good at, you know, it's just, it's so it's sort of this interesting thing because it's like it's almost like interpreting the wrong thing.

1129
01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.230
Valerie Stoehr: You know, yeah, yeah.

1130
01:40:03.210 --> 01:40:07.050
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah. Well, that's the nice thing about like these tracks.

1131
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:20.130
Valerie Stoehr: That go with it. Go with the video tag. I don't know if the audio tags supports all the tracks in the same way, but you know where you can have under the law. You have it right here.

1132
01:40:24.210 --> 01:40:25.950
Valerie Stoehr: The tracks.

1133
01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:33.030
Valerie Stoehr: Right here.

1134
01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:35.190
Valerie Stoehr: The track.

1135
01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:39.090
Valerie Stoehr: But, um,

1136
01:40:40.890 --> 01:40:42.510
mctavish: Yeah, we could choose different like

1137
01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:53.790
Valerie Stoehr: You. I mean, you can have a subtitle thing and you can have a chapter thing. You can have a descriptions track like you know there's tracks. I mean, it's not just the subtitle

1138
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:54.870
mctavish: Right, right.

1139
01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:56.430
mctavish: Right, right, right.

1140
01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:59.130
Valerie Stoehr: There's different ways to do it.

1141
01:40:59.370 --> 01:41:12.570
mctavish: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So you can choose like which is your like I yeah it's like a deaf person stream where it's like they want the person who's transliterated every word. They want to see the actual every word that the person saying because it was an

1142
01:41:12.570 --> 01:41:13.770
mctavish: English choice of words.

1143
01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:21.180
mctavish: Yeah, they want to have that rolling across and then maybe they want the ASL interpreter who is doing cultural translation, you know, mapping

1144
01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:23.100
mctavish: Like actual language mapping

1145
01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:28.230
mctavish: But you but if if they had the choice that well both right actual words.

1146
01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.380
mctavish: Oh yeah, he said.

1147
01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:33.240
mctavish: Yeah.

1148
01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:35.880
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

1149
01:41:37.110 --> 01:41:41.250
Valerie Stoehr: So maybe you just have to take that track element and just kind of like, put it on.

1150
01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:44.760
Valerie Stoehr: Everything I mean we can't

1151
01:41:45.090 --> 01:41:47.250
mctavish: No, I think that's right. Right. No, I think that's right.

1152
01:41:47.490 --> 01:41:47.790
Yeah.

1153
01:41:49.950 --> 01:41:55.860
mctavish: And I think that, but it makes me like a lot more thoughtful about things like clink, what is the tax you know in the link

1154
01:41:56.010 --> 01:41:57.270
Valerie Stoehr: Yes, yes.

1155
01:41:57.840 --> 01:41:58.230
Yes.

1156
01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:03.450
mctavish: Like I'm actually but but that's something about good semantic design. Right.

1157
01:42:03.690 --> 01:42:05.490
Valerie Stoehr: Yes, exactly. Don't put here.

1158
01:42:06.330 --> 01:42:06.600
Yeah.

1159
01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:15.330
mctavish: Yeah, yeah, it's just this thing about and then not to just put something that's not an ailing like a do with an On Click event.

1160
01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:18.870
mctavish: Like actually put an anchor tag, because that's what you mean.

1161
01:42:19.050 --> 01:42:21.210
Valerie Stoehr: Right, right. That's right.

1162
01:42:23.790 --> 01:42:25.620
Valerie Stoehr: I mean didn't do tags.

1163
01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:30.450
Valerie Stoehr: To they need to happen very much

1164
01:42:31.770 --> 01:42:37.440
mctavish: Well, I think they're just useful what what they are is they're just like a useful block element right so if you want

1165
01:42:38.490 --> 01:42:54.510
mctavish: Mean paragraphs or that but developments there useful like you know as a container like if you want to have something that's like a flex box like the container of it, the rapper. You know, so you can make. So, so it's like saying, Okay, this is this little thing.

1166
01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:57.060
mctavish: Within and I'm going to do all this placement

1167
01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:57.480
Valerie Stoehr: You know,

1168
01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:01.110
mctavish: So it's kind of like it's just like drawing a box.

1169
01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:05.190
Valerie Stoehr: Where they're probably wouldn't be a different semantic

1170
01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:10.290
Valerie Stoehr: Tag Team like dem probably is appropriate in those situations.

1171
01:43:11.010 --> 01:43:24.420
mctavish: And so like an article tigers, because it's not really an article, it's not really a section. Suddenly a paragraph. It's like a, it's like a. It's kind of like a span element right like a spin on it. It's just because you want to say, I want to be able to touch this thing.

1172
01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:30.750
mctavish: Yeah, some reason like I want to be able to this word amongst the whole paragraph of stuff. I want to be able to

1173
01:43:31.710 --> 01:43:32.970
mctavish: For some reason, reach into

1174
01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:33.930
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

1175
01:43:34.230 --> 01:43:34.620
And

1176
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:47.460
mctavish: Identify you know like says just this like it. Yeah, so I think about them. It's just like saying if and then I think it's really so help for like you sometimes just have to have a rapper.

1177
01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:52.890
mctavish: Yeah, this doesn't have any semantic reason except for that this is going to be my flex box rapper.

1178
01:43:53.130 --> 01:43:55.350
mctavish: This is where some of the flex stuff is going to happen.

1179
01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:59.910
mctavish: You put that article level. But like you said, but then you don't want all articles to be

1180
01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:02.910
mctavish: I mean, it's like it's kind of a visual thing.

1181
01:44:02.970 --> 01:44:04.110
mctavish: So it is kind of about

1182
01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:09.270
mctavish: You know, a structural it's more like just the structural box that's free of any

1183
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:12.510
mctavish: You know informational meeting.

1184
01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:16.200
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, because I didn't really know like there's so

1185
01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:33.540
Valerie Stoehr: Like it's sort of like I didn't really. I mean, I kind of knew they existed but not really. So when I took these early class like I it's like, what's the fucking div tag again like span. I've never seen you before. Yeah, nothing. I had done did that.

1186
01:44:33.810 --> 01:44:40.440
Valerie Stoehr: Right, and so it's like it's just seems like cheating every which way. You know, like, what are we

1187
01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:47.910
Valerie Stoehr: Doing but then when I did it, you know, then I could kind of see how it sort of makes sense.

1188
01:44:49.110 --> 01:45:01.230
mctavish: It's like the most generic thing that doesn't have semantic meaning because like like you don't want to have to assert that this is a paragraph, because that's about taxes semantic meaning. Right. It's not a section. It's not an article it said

1189
01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:02.190
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

1190
01:45:02.250 --> 01:45:02.520
mctavish: You know it.

1191
01:45:02.850 --> 01:45:05.610
mctavish: Could be. It's better to use a fake year if you're going to do a finger.

1192
01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:06.420
Valerie Stoehr: Around it

1193
01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:13.830
mctavish: Yeah, it's just like a completely devoid of semantic like it's kind of nice to have that all set. Right. I mean, it's just like this.

1194
01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:22.620
mctavish: Yeah, it's just a something called a set. It's not the integers and stuff that you use the word set you just mean and the most abstract

1195
01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:23.700
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

1196
01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:32.820
mctavish: You know block element in line element is what you're saying with those two things. So it's like it's like devoid of semantic meaning in a way

1197
01:45:32.970 --> 01:45:33.720
Valerie Stoehr: What would it be

1198
01:45:35.340 --> 01:45:39.060
Valerie Stoehr: Like what if you had a page is pretty much just all dibs because because

1199
01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:42.240
mctavish: People used to develop like that all the time. I used to develop like that all the time.

1200
01:45:43.230 --> 01:45:46.230
mctavish: Because I like the way and then you're just putting classes, you're just putting

1201
01:45:47.970 --> 01:45:49.800
mctavish: You know, you're just putting things that could be

1202
01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:52.800
mctavish: Select you know selector.

1203
01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:57.690
mctavish: Yeah, things I used to develop an All have sinned spans.

1204
01:45:58.530 --> 01:46:01.140
Valerie Stoehr: I mean like it's wrong, but

1205
01:46:02.370 --> 01:46:03.270
mctavish: I liked it.

1206
01:46:03.420 --> 01:46:04.380
mctavish: Yeah, reason

1207
01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:12.150
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, like but and would there be a way, you know, especially just thinking, especially visually, like, you know, we're kind of doing art now.

1208
01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:13.590
Valerie Stoehr: You know, so maybe

1209
01:46:15.210 --> 01:46:27.870
Valerie Stoehr: You know, if we're not really trying to have hierarchical structured content. We're just trying to have moving balls or, I don't know, you know, then it might be fine to just have a page full of notes right it's like a

1210
01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:45.330
mctavish: Like yeah, like so. On my on all my pages. There's like these. There's like DIV DIV DIV and I call him a frame. So I say classical is frame is when someone and then what a frame does is it just like says hundred percent 100% height absolute position.

1211
01:46:45.570 --> 01:46:48.720
mctavish: Yeah, starting answer. So just stay there. Stay the foot there.

1212
01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:51.180
Valerie Stoehr: If you need some magical structure on your pages.

1213
01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:55.290
mctavish: And I have all the content is semantically structured so

1214
01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:57.840
mctavish: Okay, so I am. And then I have a main

1215
01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:10.590
mctavish: You know, sigh, you know, it's still cleaning it up. So I'm still deciding my semantic search for but it's like I have a flex me having. Yeah. And then, but for the so I have like a content frame which is a dev

1216
01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:19.950
mctavish: Uh huh. I say content frame. I have the SVG frame. I have a sub text frame which for that photosynthesis thing has that other text.

1217
01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:27.690
mctavish: So, and then, you know, so I'll have these div tag. I have a word frame, you know, that like, it's like words that could flood them in the front.

1218
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.650
mctavish: You know,

1219
01:47:29.130 --> 01:47:41.670
mctavish: So it's like so. But the and those are those are these their, their frames, you know, like that. I think about my stages, like I'm just setting the stage I'm setting the stage I'm setting the Z index on them.

1220
01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:50.190
mctavish: You know, here's the stages. The stages. The stages this content and then the content of that's when I start saying article section.

1221
01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:50.520
mctavish: You know,

1222
01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:51.660
mctavish: I have that

1223
01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:58.200
mctavish: Without semantic meaning. Yeah. What I'm doing actually with my with all of the

1224
01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:02.100
mctavish: Content is I'm putting it within an article

1225
01:48:03.180 --> 01:48:06.240
mctavish: But then I'm using all lists. So you will

1226
01:48:06.930 --> 01:48:08.580
mctavish: With the class of stands on

1227
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:22.320
mctavish: And then all these Li. So all these lists elements. Yeah. And so that's what I can say what now I want it to be in line. Now I don't want it to be, you know, so I can say in lane black, you know, and so

1228
01:48:24.690 --> 01:48:26.130
mctavish: That's that's the

1229
01:48:27.210 --> 01:48:31.710
mctavish: End. So some of the animation of the text. It's just by swapping out the class that's on that UL

1230
01:48:33.090 --> 01:48:33.540
mctavish: Element.

1231
01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:37.200
mctavish: You know, so I just so it's so it's just

1232
01:48:39.540 --> 01:48:52.110
mctavish: But I'm doing, I decided to use that list because it's like, to me like they all are these like Stan. That's what a poem is because I am before I always had like this just like semantic argument with myself, is it like when a poet writes so they put a br

1233
01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:52.950
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

1234
01:48:53.010 --> 01:49:03.120
mctavish: Is it a break. You know, is it or is it like a dip, dip, dip, dip it you know it's a name. And so then I thought, well, no, it's a list. So it's like, so a standard is that UL is a list. So there's these

1235
01:49:03.810 --> 01:49:07.650
mctavish: And so I just decided to think of it, semantically like that for this project.

1236
01:49:08.130 --> 01:49:13.050
Valerie Stoehr: That's nice. I like that. I those br tags also just the kind of budget.

1237
01:49:13.890 --> 01:49:15.300
mctavish: Yeah, you know,

1238
01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:16.380
Valerie Stoehr: I know

1239
01:49:16.650 --> 01:49:23.250
mctavish: Because they do something but you know they're articulate right because they what they mean is they mean a white space element.

1240
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:26.400
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, I mean, it's not bad but they're just like

1241
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:35.910
mctavish: They don't enclose. They're not like these chunks like that's why for a while, I would do poetry as DIV DIV DIV DIV, you know, for each of the lines, but that didn't seem right either. You know,

1242
01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:37.980
mctavish: Yeah, like so.

1243
01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:48.990
Valerie Stoehr: Well, and they don't. It just doesn't feel response. You know how that that concept of that white space, you know when it's non breaking or not. And, you know,

1244
01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:49.650
Yeah.

1245
01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:57.690
Valerie Stoehr: So the list thing is just so much more better. You know, like do you want space between your list items. Tell me about it now.

1246
01:49:57.750 --> 01:50:11.010
mctavish: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And then like how there's those symbols that change at the end of, you know, so that's just and then what's nice is like if you you can do like in then. So you could say every first

1247
01:50:12.090 --> 01:50:13.320
mctavish: You know list element.

1248
01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:21.240
mctavish: Every second element, you know, every third you say you say every other element, you know, there's all this kind of things that you can do about children then

1249
01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:22.530
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah. Nice.

1250
01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:24.540
mctavish: Because those are children of a dancer.

1251
01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:28.500
mctavish: Yeah. So yeah, so you can do the sectors are sort of rich

1252
01:50:28.770 --> 01:50:29.700
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah yeah

1253
01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:38.520
mctavish: In that way, and you do like the first letter of the first. Yeah, they should be really huge. And it could look like old school.

1254
01:50:38.730 --> 01:50:40.440
mctavish: Yes, because I think it gives a lot of

1255
01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:44.490
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

1256
01:50:47.610 --> 01:50:48.030
mctavish: Anyway,

1257
01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:50.520
mctavish: Lovely talking to you about this.

1258
01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:57.150
mctavish: It helps me actually structure my mind to about like, no, it's that's that's not wrong to be HTML, CSS, that's

1259
01:50:58.170 --> 01:51:02.250
mctavish: So my early work all the animation was in CSS like none and

1260
01:51:04.530 --> 01:51:06.000
mctavish: You know, it's interesting to

1261
01:51:07.770 --> 01:51:11.160
mctavish: It so performant now to, you know, like, that's just a great

1262
01:51:14.190 --> 01:51:16.650
mctavish: Combination HTML and CSS just so

1263
01:51:17.130 --> 01:51:17.970
So performance.

1264
01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:23.400
Valerie Stoehr: Cool.

1265
01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:27.180
mctavish: Good job you're doing. It's very interesting.

1266
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:29.070
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

1267
01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:33.660
mctavish: Does that make you hate media though sometimes to like video

1268
01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:36.690
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah yeah

1269
01:51:38.850 --> 01:51:39.990
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah. Uh huh.

1270
01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:42.120
mctavish: It's heavy.

1271
01:51:42.570 --> 01:51:49.830
Valerie Stoehr: But, well, it just feels like I was on my walk. And I'm like, wait, how can I go in and manipulate the video. Like, I just want to manipulate it right

1272
01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:50.850
mctavish: Right, right.

1273
01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:52.110
mctavish: Right, yeah.

1274
01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:53.970
Valerie Stoehr: I'm just

1275
01:51:58.110 --> 01:52:07.230
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, like I kind of I've so I had another dream. So I'll have these dreams where I where I fly or where I just kind of hover.

1276
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:10.110
Valerie Stoehr: You know, you can just go like that and just sort of me.

1277
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:18.180
Valerie Stoehr: And I headed. I woke up this morning and I was so bummed because what it finally happened was I was

1278
01:52:19.530 --> 01:52:29.640
Valerie Stoehr: Out and there was a class going on where people were, they were doing it. They were kind of like hovering above the ground, you know, a couple feet and stuff. It was kind of a class, but how to do that. And I like

1279
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:40.350
Valerie Stoehr: JESUS FUCK like I went and talked to the instructor, you know, because I feel like I just feel so close to being able to do that. Like I do it in dreams. It feels so real.

1280
01:52:40.890 --> 01:52:51.450
Valerie Stoehr: And like I know I just feel like I know it can be done. And so I need to like learn. I need to be in your class and my hands. And she said, Well, are you ready

1281
01:52:52.230 --> 01:53:00.870
Valerie Stoehr: And it was a man and a woman who kind of CO teach and she did with the fortune teller did in India and India, where he looked at the

1282
01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:09.300
Valerie Stoehr: Like my fingernails, he kind of studied hard he wanted to know my birth dates and he was kind of writing like shapes you know like you would

1283
01:53:09.930 --> 01:53:18.750
Valerie Stoehr: To figure that out. And then he like, looked at each of my fingernail things. And so she like looked at my comments. Interesting. That's the same thing that dude did

1284
01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:28.560
Valerie Stoehr: And then they said to me, like, Are you ready, how, how would you put your hands. And I said, like this and they set out you're ready then because when people say like this. They're not ready.

1285
01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:31.500
Valerie Stoehr: Okay.

1286
01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:35.160
Valerie Stoehr: So excited and then like I woke up and I'm like,

1287
01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:46.350
Valerie Stoehr: Oh, I thought this time I was finally get to do it for real.

1288
01:53:46.710 --> 01:53:52.560
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah. Um, oh my God, what was I gonna say about that. What were you just talking about that.

1289
01:53:54.330 --> 01:53:55.740
mctavish: Video any video

1290
01:53:55.860 --> 01:54:10.830
Valerie Stoehr: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. So I was out of my walk. And I'm like, wait a minute. You can you can use H. You can go in and manipulate the video right programmatically like

1291
01:54:12.570 --> 01:54:15.570
Valerie Stoehr: Oh no, like, you know, was that a dream state thing like

1292
01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:16.590
Valerie Stoehr: It's not is it

1293
01:54:17.010 --> 01:54:24.720
Valerie Stoehr: I kind of forgot from my I couldn't remember if it was real or not, you know, and it's like on. I don't think it's real. I don't think we can you know

1294
01:54:25.470 --> 01:54:30.570
Valerie Stoehr: But like we shouldn't be able to, we should be able to kind of

1295
01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:31.740
mctavish: Write

1296
01:54:32.070 --> 01:54:44.760
Valerie Stoehr: You that like I'm looking at the Art 21 homepage is still up in the background. And with that, you know, the people in the balloon and everything and like I should just be able to kind of like make her move forward. Make the balloon.

1297
01:54:45.090 --> 01:54:46.260
mctavish: Yeah, just

1298
01:54:46.860 --> 01:54:47.580
mctavish: Do data.

1299
01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:55.860
mctavish: You can kind of do it by bringing onto canvas. But that's sort of, it sounds like you want to create it, but declarative way right

1300
01:54:55.950 --> 01:54:58.080
Valerie Stoehr: Yes, right. I know.

1301
01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:03.510
Valerie Stoehr: I know like maybe I will probably get well, will we get there.

1302
01:55:06.990 --> 01:55:11.790
Valerie Stoehr: I guess in that way that video games are kind of went from this thing to something else.

1303
01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:15.300
Valerie Stoehr: But we'll still have moving pictures and

1304
01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:18.990
Valerie Stoehr: tog Rafi and video kind of be something

1305
01:55:19.410 --> 01:55:19.800
mctavish: Mm hmm.

1306
01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:20.970
But

1307
01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:24.840
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah video is kind of weird.

1308
01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:33.210
Valerie Stoehr: Because there's some other media that we need to invent

1309
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:44.430
mctavish: I've always been interested in, like, if you have like a really huge image, like say you had a big image and then that you would move around in the image space.

1310
01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:45.450
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

1311
01:55:45.630 --> 01:55:47.370
mctavish: So it was like, way bigger than your view.

1312
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:50.340
mctavish: Yeah, but like if you actually

1313
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:51.990
Valerie Stoehr: That's like President you

1314
01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:53.790
mctavish: Hold it. It's like sort of micro fish.

1315
01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:55.230
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

1316
01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:57.570
mctavish: Just move the image around to see it or

1317
01:55:57.570 --> 01:56:03.240
mctavish: Something like I think that would be an interesting way of feeling if you wanted to feel like you're in this world.

1318
01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:08.130
mctavish: Yeah, like you wanted to get, you know, zoom over to see that the river, you know,

1319
01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:09.630
mctavish: See the

1320
01:56:10.110 --> 01:56:11.910
mctavish: At one bird street, you know, like

1321
01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:12.960
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah yeah

1322
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:15.330
mctavish: So it feel like microfiche or something.

1323
01:56:16.110 --> 01:56:18.300
Valerie Stoehr: Like Google map for

1324
01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:21.540
Valerie Stoehr: As long just sort of

1325
01:56:22.050 --> 01:56:22.530
Yeah.

1326
01:56:24.090 --> 01:56:26.040
Valerie Stoehr: geo location like I

1327
01:56:26.130 --> 01:56:28.320
Valerie Stoehr: Said the Geolocation API.

1328
01:56:28.650 --> 01:56:33.360
Valerie Stoehr: Right, an object we define that's an art piece or something.

1329
01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:36.960
mctavish: Yeah, something like that. I feel like there's something interesting and and

1330
01:56:37.710 --> 01:56:39.960
mctavish: Yeah, that or

1331
01:56:41.250 --> 01:56:42.180
mctavish: Or in

1332
01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:47.130
mctavish: You could slow down and video right and

1333
01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:50.100
mctavish: closet and

1334
01:56:50.610 --> 01:56:51.450
Valerie Stoehr: That's true.

1335
01:56:54.210 --> 01:56:56.790
mctavish: You can keep like knowing like where are we now, where are we now,

1336
01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:58.230
Valerie Stoehr: Where we know all that's true.

1337
01:56:58.830 --> 01:56:59.940
mctavish: Two minutes 12 seconds.

1338
01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:01.680
mctavish: Okay, now posit

1339
01:57:01.890 --> 01:57:02.730
Yeah.

1340
01:57:04.170 --> 01:57:05.280
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, that's true.

1341
01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:07.740
mctavish: Interesting.

1342
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:10.530
mctavish: Exercise actually

1343
01:57:16.290 --> 01:57:20.100
Valerie Stoehr: But like, what if you want to manipulate the content make happy ending.

1344
01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:23.280
mctavish: Right.

1345
01:57:23.910 --> 01:57:26.550
Valerie Stoehr: Make the bad person go back in the shadow

1346
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:34.080
mctavish: Yeah yeah people play a lot with transmedia that way. But it's always sort of a boring click right it's like click to see the other film.

1347
01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:35.400
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm. Yeah.

1348
01:57:37.140 --> 01:57:40.500
mctavish: Click to see that person's backstory, which just goes to another film.

1349
01:57:40.830 --> 01:57:42.990
Valerie Stoehr: Right. But how do you have an

1350
01:57:44.610 --> 01:57:45.480
Valerie Stoehr: Interactive

1351
01:57:46.830 --> 01:57:48.210
Valerie Stoehr: Conversation with it.

1352
01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:51.510
mctavish: Let's are like if you could mark up all the frames.

1353
01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:53.430
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm. Mm.

1354
01:57:54.510 --> 01:57:55.800
Valerie Stoehr: Hmm, yeah.

1355
01:57:56.250 --> 01:57:58.770
mctavish: Did you ever see a map man with a movie camera.

1356
01:57:59.790 --> 01:58:00.540
mctavish: By Brittany.

1357
01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:10.710
mctavish: Know it's really cool. It's like one of the first like he's rushing right. One of the very early film things when people are like, what the hell you know like where they have no idea what to do with it.

1358
01:58:11.130 --> 01:58:17.250
mctavish: Yeah, life. So you took, like, all this footage. Like you could just see he's like absolutely on speed with us.

1359
01:58:17.250 --> 01:58:17.700
mctavish: Like just

1360
01:58:18.150 --> 01:58:34.020
mctavish: Ecstatic over this new form of work. And so you should see it. You can see it. You just like Google it and see it, but his wife kept her name was. But she was the editor, which was a profound part of this whole thing right

1361
01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:34.860
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, like

1362
01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:50.880
mctavish: A PERFORMANCE thing. So she had all these like drawers and drawers of video and images. Right. And then she's doing all the cut and all the splay slicing and dicing and choosing how fast or how slow you know to do these things. And so she

1363
01:58:52.440 --> 01:59:01.770
mctavish: So it's just kind of really it's just cool because it's just such ecstasy over the idea of moving picture before they knew what moving picture had to be

1364
01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:09.630
mctavish: And she's brilliant a brilliant editor. It's like, it's very cool but it kind of gives you that idea of what would you do if you could do anything.

1365
01:59:09.930 --> 01:59:10.470
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

1366
01:59:10.770 --> 01:59:12.540
mctavish: Yeah, excellent. You'd have really slow.

1367
01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:15.780
mctavish: Yeah, let's down that frame for a while. It stands for me.

1368
01:59:15.810 --> 01:59:17.220
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah yeah

1369
01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:18.900
mctavish: Especially as you go.

1370
01:59:20.130 --> 01:59:24.840
mctavish: Like now let's do it. You know, it's, it's, yeah, it's just really interesting to see.

1371
01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:28.950
mctavish: Like to go back to that beginner's mind with that. I think it's really

1372
01:59:29.610 --> 01:59:29.970
Valerie Stoehr: You know,

1373
01:59:30.150 --> 01:59:38.490
mctavish: Very useful things. Is it so if you, you know, and pretty soon, like memory won't be a problem, right. So you could really think of storing all these frames.

1374
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.500
mctavish: And

1375
01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:45.330
mctavish: See others like you don't think of video as a kind of a stuck thing, but more like I said

1376
01:59:46.230 --> 01:59:47.880
mctavish: It's just this long list of

1377
01:59:48.300 --> 02:00:00.630
mctavish: A UI UL a long list of friends and then and tweens. You know, so you might have like so frames and then how do you move from frame to frame, you know, there might be some

1378
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:04.560
mctavish: Sense of, you know, inserting

1379
02:00:06.030 --> 02:00:08.070
mctavish: Some transitional effects or something.

1380
02:00:15.150 --> 02:00:22.110
mctavish: I mean, because like print like us, as I can't remember which guys we kind of pointing out video and audio or just data.

1381
02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:29.370
mctavish: You know, it's just data digital video is just like a list of pixels.

1382
02:00:30.510 --> 02:00:33.450
mctavish: You know, being delivered very, very fast form.

1383
02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:41.250
mctavish: Yeah, but if you just, you know, so there's nothing that means you can't interrupt that for, you know, talk to that data in a different way.

1384
02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:42.150
Valerie Stoehr: Wow.

1385
02:00:42.990 --> 02:00:47.400
mctavish: So you're just going in a way. You're forcing your browser to do a stereotypical thing with that.

1386
02:00:48.990 --> 02:00:53.100
mctavish: Data, but you don't need to like that's what a lot of color chart is right. Let's pull it into

1387
02:00:54.150 --> 02:01:06.840
mctavish: You know the interrupt that process. I'm all like, so people it right into Canvas and then screw with the pixel color or something you know you can do you turn it all black and white is just life turn everything black and white.

1388
02:01:07.890 --> 02:01:08.310
mctavish: Or

1389
02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:21.390
Valerie Stoehr: You would mark biologic people were working with us. The no sequel company that was founded by a guy that I used to work with Ingress

1390
02:01:21.570 --> 02:01:22.680
Valerie Stoehr: As it turns out,

1391
02:01:25.410 --> 02:01:31.140
Valerie Stoehr: When he was working at the public, the publisher place with the drinking problem.

1392
02:01:32.940 --> 02:01:36.660
Valerie Stoehr: It was cool, talking with them because I can't

1393
02:01:38.430 --> 02:01:52.740
Valerie Stoehr: It's been a while. My head can't kind of go back to that very clearly right now, but they were talking about like what the you know what their big customers were doing, you know, like the Disney Studios, you know, we're all over it. Right, like they were putting all of their

1394
02:01:53.130 --> 02:01:54.510
Valerie Stoehr: Films because

1395
02:01:55.650 --> 02:02:09.660
Valerie Stoehr: Like, like they're seeing it that way. Right. It's just data, data, data, data, data. And it's this. It can be unstructured, it can be really flexible and you can just, you know, recombine your tables dynamically and and

1396
02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:13.260
Valerie Stoehr: I feel like it was

1397
02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:16.980
Valerie Stoehr: You know, I know the news organizations, but I feel like

1398
02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.990
Valerie Stoehr: I want to say like the auto manufacturer. Like, I can't remember all the

1399
02:02:23.310 --> 02:02:25.080
Valerie Stoehr: All this stuff.

1400
02:02:26.130 --> 02:02:29.010
Valerie Stoehr: But, but it's that kind of thinking

1401
02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:37.530
Valerie Stoehr: It is just data, you know, it is just bagel bagel bagel data.

1402
02:03:01.980 --> 02:03:01.980
Valerie Stoehr: Amen.

1403
02:03:03.930 --> 02:03:05.100
mctavish: Well, that

1404
02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:09.420
Valerie Stoehr: Well, and speaking of data. This recording will be like one big honkin file.

1405
02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:15.090
mctavish: I wasn't the same because there's this thing called I'm just trying to name.

1406
02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:20.940
mctavish: The where you can actually just program like each pixel of the screen. So you think of

1407
02:03:21.420 --> 02:03:30.300
mctavish: Instead of thinking of it as, as you like, you can have each thing being directed by its own flow, you know, so if you actually were to program like that and

1408
02:03:30.570 --> 02:03:45.480
mctavish: This is this pixel. This is this, you know, so if you instead of like, I'm thinking of the ball that's going around like this. But if you think like that, you know, so there's so there's ways of programming, like that. And actually, they're using that in something called TensorFlow to do

1409
02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:48.480
mctavish: AI in the browser.

1410
02:03:48.870 --> 02:03:56.460
mctavish: Hmm, because this, this way of doing multi doing using the graphics card, which is very fast, right. So you're doing you're using the GPU with like to do

1411
02:03:57.930 --> 02:04:07.950
mctavish: What what is really computationally intensive AI, you know, so you're having a due process live and within the browser without having to go to a server and do the hard

1412
02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:09.660
mctavish: You know processing.

1413
02:04:10.350 --> 02:04:11.610
mctavish: To actually use the

1414
02:04:12.930 --> 02:04:13.320
mctavish: Do

1415
02:04:13.410 --> 02:04:14.490
mctavish: divert the

1416
02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:16.710
mctavish: GPU skill.

1417
02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:18.990
mctavish: Which is parallel processing.

1418
02:04:19.890 --> 02:04:21.450
mctavish: at a rapid rate.

1419
02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:26.970
mctavish: Right and and use it to do information prize, you know, to do thinking

1420
02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:29.460
mctavish: Sort of interesting like

1421
02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:31.290
mctavish: To think about

1422
02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:36.030
mctavish: Makes you think that, think about that screen that are really different.

1423
02:04:41.190 --> 02:04:42.000
Valerie Stoehr: That's cool.

1424
02:04:42.420 --> 02:04:44.730
mctavish: It's kind of like Flatland, he would. Awesome.

1425
02:04:45.150 --> 02:04:47.790
mctavish: Yeah encomium pixels like thinkers

1426
02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:54.270
mctavish: Are the pixels are all seeing. It's like, it's like it is like shape not saying that they're all doing their thing.

1427
02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:56.700
mctavish: Same time

1428
02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:03.390
mctavish: This one's getting quite. Oh, this one, you know, they're all doing this.

1429
02:05:09.090 --> 02:05:15.750
Valerie Stoehr: I tell you that I used to maybe I mentioned this, there's this jamelia software where I direct

1430
02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:17.100
mctavish: Yeah yeah

1431
02:05:18.030 --> 02:05:23.670
Valerie Stoehr: And so I did get it working. So counted one same where it just like

1432
02:05:25.590 --> 02:05:43.230
Valerie Stoehr: They did a test thing for me where it didn't work. But then it then it kind of resolved on its own. And so then I went to one. And I asked. I started crying actually like when I first plugged in, because like I could hear everyone again.

1433
02:05:43.260 --> 02:05:43.560
mctavish: Yeah.

1434
02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:45.330
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, it was just like oh

1435
02:05:45.810 --> 02:05:46.980
Valerie Stoehr: My god.

1436
02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:48.390
mctavish: Yeah, well,

1437
02:05:48.720 --> 02:06:07.080
Valerie Stoehr: You know the multi. It's so, like, amazing to hear like you know the multiple voices, like, again, it was so moving. And so it was this huge hi, and then it was also hard because there's still a little bit of a delay.

1438
02:06:07.290 --> 02:06:16.890
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah. And so what people have to do is just stay with the beat you getting the ball back

1439
02:06:17.070 --> 02:06:20.010
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, and be singing with what you hear.

1440
02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:25.440
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, and like the leaders know that that was enough people who

1441
02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:27.360
mctavish: Don't it

1442
02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:33.330
Valerie Stoehr: Is very new that they've kind of. And so, you know, how long can

1443
02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:37.950
Valerie Stoehr: Assess lines just end up

1444
02:06:38.370 --> 02:06:44.040
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, I'll stick with the bead and sometimes I've muted myself and I just stick with the beat.

1445
02:06:44.610 --> 02:06:47.400
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, but then they're way off.

1446
02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:49.560
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, and

1447
02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:56.910
Valerie Stoehr: So i and then I like okay, I'll just slow down. I'll just sing with them. Okay, now I'll just stay like a little bit ahead, not have not

1448
02:06:57.360 --> 02:06:57.750
Great.

1449
02:06:59.100 --> 02:07:00.420
Valerie Stoehr: Um, you know,

1450
02:07:01.110 --> 02:07:01.770
Valerie Stoehr: So,

1451
02:07:02.220 --> 02:07:07.950
Valerie Stoehr: I did that for like about 45 minutes or so and then I'm like, Okay, I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do with this, you know,

1452
02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:08.460
Right.

1453
02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:12.240
Valerie Stoehr: So I'm going to go back another time.

1454
02:07:13.770 --> 02:07:24.360
Valerie Stoehr: And just see, but I love like the field recording that I posted is from the Philadelphia group and the Philadelphia group is doing this and

1455
02:07:25.770 --> 02:07:32.970
Valerie Stoehr: I just, I'm really started like I think that Philly group, I could really love like it's that Pennsylvania singing that got canceled.

1456
02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:46.470
Valerie Stoehr: That I was going to go to. And there's, I think they've got some cool stuff going on in Pennsylvania. So I kind of might want to just join their sayings, just because of the just to make connection there.

1457
02:07:49.290 --> 02:08:01.950
Valerie Stoehr: And then Omaha saying they're doing it. And I think they're doing I'm out on the West Coast, too. But so I'm kind of thinking like this. Like when I posted that recording, just to put it on the website to

1458
02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:07.380
Valerie Stoehr: It kind of help me.

1459
02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:20.340
Valerie Stoehr: Um, you know, back to those questions about what the fuck am I doing, you know, to think, okay, like right now. This is an awesome time for me to build the connections.

1460
02:08:20.430 --> 02:08:21.600
Valerie Stoehr: To be like maybe

1461
02:08:21.690 --> 02:08:33.690
Valerie Stoehr: Maybe I am going to want to be playing with different recordings of shape note things and it's going to help for me to have the personal relationships because people don't really want like what are you doing with our recordings

1462
02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:34.290
mctavish: Mm hmm.

1463
02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:40.470
Valerie Stoehr: You know, it's for an insider to do that. Mm hmm. You know, it's just easier and better

1464
02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:45.510
Valerie Stoehr: And and I can totally do that here in Minnesota, but kind of for the national group.

1465
02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:56.160
Valerie Stoehr: Room, like, okay, so I'll go to the jamelia sings maybe that I'll just figure out a way because it's also about building the connections, it's also like

1466
02:08:56.610 --> 02:09:09.900
Valerie Stoehr: Look at, like, this is an amazing time like we've never had jampolis field recordings before you know like that one was, that was an in person one but um that I posted. But like, there's like, cool.

1467
02:09:10.650 --> 02:09:17.940
Valerie Stoehr: Um, there's cool things I could be getting digitally right now you know that might be part of something

1468
02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:20.070
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, and so

1469
02:09:22.830 --> 02:09:27.030
Valerie Stoehr: So it just felt like a time when kind of the worlds are coming together. Right. It's kind of

1470
02:09:27.900 --> 02:09:29.730
Valerie Stoehr: I don't know what I'm doing but

1471
02:09:34.170 --> 02:09:46.860
Valerie Stoehr: But doing something I've got some weird I got just such a weird strange intersection of shape note and Quaker, and then all my own yeah its own stuff and

1472
02:09:47.640 --> 02:09:47.970
Right.

1473
02:09:49.530 --> 02:09:49.800
mctavish: Right.

1474
02:09:50.670 --> 02:09:51.960
Valerie Stoehr: Somehow, it will come out.

1475
02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:53.490
mctavish: Yeah.

1476
02:09:56.220 --> 02:09:57.210
mctavish: Yeah, I think that's

1477
02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:02.400
mctavish: It, there's this backbone of information thinking or something.

1478
02:10:03.150 --> 02:10:05.520
mctavish: And then there's these things like that might

1479
02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:10.140
mctavish: That's interesting.

1480
02:10:11.220 --> 02:10:11.580
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah.

1481
02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:15.750
mctavish: Have fun learning all about media.

1482
02:10:16.650 --> 02:10:21.540
Valerie Stoehr: Thank you. Yeah, I'm going to go back to my slow as molasses part now and just kind of work on that.

1483
02:10:23.340 --> 02:10:25.710
Valerie Stoehr: The video API and the tracks and

1484
02:10:26.970 --> 02:10:33.810
Valerie Stoehr: But it helps like yes, I'm just not going to get like to wind up in the intricacies of all that goddamn JavaScript.

1485
02:10:35.010 --> 02:10:41.490
mctavish: What else all the things about like, and then the chat and then the transcript will happen here like it could happen just underneath that, like, I mean, you know, just all that

1486
02:10:43.650 --> 02:10:52.410
Valerie Stoehr: Right, just so I understand what's going on. Just so I can kind of harness it to the degree that I want to. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

1487
02:10:54.090 --> 02:10:57.510
Valerie Stoehr: Okay, so what are you doing, what's your next thing.

1488
02:10:58.860 --> 02:11:01.170
mctavish: I need to

1489
02:11:02.610 --> 02:11:15.000
mctavish: I want to put probably I'm thinking about putting in. So this thing called migrations. That's a you know that i don't know if you ever seen my walking shadow thing, so it'll be like a walking like Phil it's felt like my shadow walking

1490
02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:18.720
mctavish: So it's like I just took us. It's kind of like blue, white, kind of

1491
02:11:19.770 --> 02:11:22.230
mctavish: The shadow of my my whacking step.

1492
02:11:22.530 --> 02:11:24.870
mctavish: So I think that piece might be called migrations.

1493
02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:25.650
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

1494
02:11:25.890 --> 02:11:31.530
mctavish: Kind of more about and I might try to find a poem of Sheila's that's kind of about hoc migration, but then with a human.

1495
02:11:32.580 --> 02:11:38.400
mctavish: I am you know thing across this reversal kind of thing. And then that and then maybe one called siren

1496
02:11:39.090 --> 02:11:41.520
mctavish: Oh, yeah. And so, and then

1497
02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:46.320
Valerie Stoehr: You're going to add to the to the books.

1498
02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:58.170
mctavish: Yeah. And then I put out what I really need to do, does it. So if it feels pretty complete I really need to get the sound figured out, you know, like what do I want the song to be so my goal is have like by next week like

1499
02:11:59.430 --> 02:12:02.790
mctavish: That flushed out you know so and then

1500
02:12:04.410 --> 02:12:15.330
mctavish: Yeah, I want that to be that far, really. And so it feels like it's you know it's gonna, it's going to be an ongoing thing. But just so that it stands alone right now.

1501
02:12:15.870 --> 02:12:16.500
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm.

1502
02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:18.420
mctavish: So I can pass it to the bell.

1503
02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:19.620
mctavish: That's

1504
02:12:19.650 --> 02:12:21.030
mctavish: Like the final conversation.

1505
02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:26.160
mctavish: And then, and then I'm going to be making

1506
02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:35.580
mctavish: But I think I'll wait until the week after that to make me to make postcards to send out to them across the mailing list. So I have to generate like a whole PDF of

1507
02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:46.170
mctavish: These graphic graphic design things that I'll probably add to each one like this, or possibly just to the whole project. I'll add this like set of PDF books that are

1508
02:12:47.220 --> 02:12:50.520
mctavish: Like still still still still like generative still still still still

1509
02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:55.620
mctavish: So there's kind of both of those forms and possibly

1510
02:12:56.790 --> 02:12:58.890
mctavish: You know, with the attacks available somehow

1511
02:13:00.510 --> 02:13:03.060
mctavish: Separate from the animations. I'm not quite sure about that.

1512
02:13:05.790 --> 02:13:06.270
Yeah.

1513
02:13:09.750 --> 02:13:10.230
mctavish: And you

1514
02:13:11.790 --> 02:13:12.600
Valerie Stoehr: I think

1515
02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:20.070
Valerie Stoehr: I should do, I'll do a time limited thing. Like, I think I'll say I have

1516
02:13:21.150 --> 02:13:22.500
Valerie Stoehr: Through the weekend.

1517
02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:25.020
Valerie Stoehr: To go look at GitHub.

1518
02:13:25.650 --> 02:13:26.130
Valerie Stoehr: And just

1519
02:13:26.190 --> 02:13:28.230
Valerie Stoehr: Do I want to do anything with it or not.

1520
02:13:28.590 --> 02:13:29.040
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, like

1521
02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:40.200
Valerie Stoehr: There I got something over there by Sunday night, and we'll kind of like maybe do stuff over there. And if it's just like, all right, then. Nope.

1522
02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:41.610
mctavish: That's not

1523
02:13:41.670 --> 02:13:42.420
Valerie Stoehr: Gonna happen.

1524
02:13:43.710 --> 02:13:45.930
Valerie Stoehr: So I think maybe if I can just

1525
02:13:47.970 --> 02:13:54.960
Valerie Stoehr: Like Bye bye, a week from now I want to have, I guess, established like where are the files that I'm doing.

1526
02:13:55.050 --> 02:13:56.190
mctavish: What's your workspace.

1527
02:13:56.250 --> 02:13:58.050
mctavish: Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.

1528
02:13:58.500 --> 02:14:10.080
Valerie Stoehr: That and then also I will make forward progress. So like, I'm not sure how much, but I'm going to be further ahead in my class than I am right now. I mean that that one page that we just looked at.

1529
02:14:10.410 --> 02:14:13.740
Valerie Stoehr: You know, maybe I'm done with module one, but I'm not sure, because I think

1530
02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:16.140
Valerie Stoehr: Taking time for my workspace is a

1531
02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:16.560
Good.

1532
02:14:17.820 --> 02:14:18.180
mctavish: Yeah.

1533
02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:19.710
mctavish: Yeah.

1534
02:14:19.950 --> 02:14:25.440
Valerie Stoehr: Well, I'll be further for sure. In module. Well, just further along in the class.

1535
02:14:25.830 --> 02:14:29.070
mctavish: Mm hmm. Yeah, yeah. Perfect.

1536
02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:30.720
Valerie Stoehr: Okay.

1537
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.960
mctavish: Excellent.

1538
02:14:34.530 --> 02:14:35.310
Valerie Stoehr: Thank you.

1539
02:14:35.910 --> 02:14:36.510
mctavish: Thank you.

1540
02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:39.780
mctavish: You have helped me so much. I can't tell you it's like

1541
02:14:40.110 --> 02:14:40.860
mctavish: Likewise,

1542
02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:43.530
Valerie Stoehr: Thank you, super, super helpful.

1543
02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:46.470
mctavish: Good. Let's hear girlfriend.

1544
02:14:47.190 --> 02:14:47.790
Valerie Stoehr: Yeah, I will.

1545
02:14:47.940 --> 02:14:54.420

mctavish: Yeah, like I've just been really missing art museums like being able to go in

1557
02:15:35.550 --> 02:15:37.230
mctavish: And you could stay as long as you want.

1558
02:15:38.790 --> 02:15:41.700
mctavish: You can see it in their purse, the grandkids for her. It's like

1559
02:15:41.970 --> 02:15:46.560
mctavish: Yeah. Just read, they're sitting on your lap. You're just like me. No one has mass

1560
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:51.300
mctavish: Yeah, yeah, making cookies with what a Master Hand

1561
02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:51.630
That

1562
02:15:52.770 --> 02:15:57.090
mctavish: You know, so yeah. It's like, it feels like you can dare to start thinking

1563
02:15:57.540 --> 02:15:59.460
mctavish: Yeah, about those things.

1564
02:15:59.700 --> 02:16:01.320
mctavish: Yeah, so

1565
02:16:02.700 --> 02:16:05.400
mctavish: And then still wait for months, but at least you can think about them.

1566
02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:09.690
Valerie Stoehr: I know I Terry Gross had a vaccine dude on

1567
02:16:11.220 --> 02:16:24.210
Valerie Stoehr: COUPLE DAYS AGO, I felt I felt better after listening to him, you know, he's he's in Texas. I think he's at Baylor, he's been working on the vaccines that that the pharma doesn't want to do because their for

1568
02:16:25.260 --> 02:16:33.150
Valerie Stoehr: Their vaccines that don't make any money, you know, for problem Leo third world or you know development coordination kind of stuff and

1569
02:16:34.380 --> 02:16:39.690
Valerie Stoehr: And and they've worked on Corona viruses, because before like no one was really

1570
02:16:40.020 --> 02:16:40.950
Valerie Stoehr: Yes, right.

1571
02:16:41.130 --> 02:16:56.130
Valerie Stoehr: Right. Start and and so they've got a vaccine that is doing okay. It's like, oh, go, go, Mr Baylor dude go but um and so Terry was asking them all these questions and

1572
02:16:56.730 --> 02:17:06.030
Valerie Stoehr: And it made me feel better about Terry was like, well, like which vaccine. Are we supposed to take. Like, which one are you waiting for, and he said,

1573
02:17:06.330 --> 02:17:12.390
Valerie Stoehr: They're all the same like whatever one gets approved and has kind of been through the appropriate things

1574
02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:28.080
Valerie Stoehr: That's the one I want. You know, like vaccine technology is not fancy. They're all the vaccines that we have for coronavirus to kind of made on that same you know principle that we know that's like really effective. So, so just get it.

1575
02:17:29.070 --> 02:17:44.490
Valerie Stoehr: You know, like, whichever one that you know there's just maybe differences and efficacy or like whatever, but they're all the same. And like so, we learned that, you know, you're going to need a booster because the first one, you know, not so good. And then we're able to improve that, fine.

1576
02:17:44.730 --> 02:17:58.860
Valerie Stoehr: Get your first one wait for your booster and and that same thing. He was just saying, like, you know, this is just such a tragic time to develop lifelong complications of Kobe or to die.

1577
02:17:58.890 --> 02:18:01.080
Valerie Stoehr: From Coleman right now because it is

1578
02:18:01.140 --> 02:18:13.950
Valerie Stoehr: Just around the corner. Really just stay alive. You know, because you know it's like we can see it. It's coming soon. Like, oh yeah, right.

1579
02:18:14.130 --> 02:18:26.820
mctavish: Exactly, exactly. Meanwhile, my sister sent me a photo of her friend whose works like trance and transport. So he's transporting people that come in emergency emergency transport them are

1580
02:18:27.210 --> 02:18:35.940
mctavish: And so he has, like, it's like this mask. It looks like it's almost looks like Klu Klux Klan is like this weight thing and this mask and if there's oxygen that's pumped into it.

1581
02:18:37.050 --> 02:18:56.220
mctavish: So silly as accurate as our body as I mean it's amazing with the lady with the he's on team 3am it's a three elements is like. And then, and he said, like, three floors are just completely filled with Kobe, you know, and it's just like, Okay, yeah, we can just make some more beans people

1582
02:18:57.150 --> 02:18:58.830
mctavish: Know, make your cornbread.

1583
02:19:00.090 --> 02:19:05.910
mctavish: And then. Meanwhile, my dad like just went out to get birdseed but at a small local Starbucks. Still, it's like, I just think

1584
02:19:06.870 --> 02:19:07.830
Valerie Stoehr: I know

1585
02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:22.080
Valerie Stoehr: Like, I know you know I'm really, I'm kind of I'm kind of shocked. I mean, I know that Trump has poison the well. But I feel like all these stories about you know how people sacrifice in the wars and blah blah

1586
02:19:22.770 --> 02:19:26.730
Valerie Stoehr: Blah, like is no one reaching back into that.

1587
02:19:27.300 --> 02:19:27.900
mctavish: I know right.

1588
02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:35.520
Valerie Stoehr: I mean like you fucking can't live without thanksgiving for one god damn year. I mean, it just

1589
02:19:36.030 --> 02:19:38.400
mctavish: Right. And did you did you listen to the button speech.

1590
02:19:39.420 --> 02:19:42.480
Valerie Stoehr: Only what CNN had for a condensed

1591
02:19:42.660 --> 02:19:44.400
mctavish: Thing. It was really great. I was like,

1592
02:19:44.490 --> 02:19:51.570
mctavish: Yeah, I like listening to Mr. Rogers when you just need it because it was, but it was really good. He because he was reaching into all of that.

1593
02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:57.630
mctavish: Yeah, our patriotic duty. We have done it before. We can do this together like just this that language that you use.

1594
02:19:57.660 --> 02:20:05.970
mctavish: Around more time that you know we're not at war with each other. We're at war with this virus, like this, like, just this. It was just such a leadership.

1595
02:20:06.360 --> 02:20:09.300
mctavish: Yeah. Dang, and just turned it on its head about

1596
02:20:09.420 --> 02:20:11.370
mctavish: Yeah, selfishness, you know,

1597
02:20:12.420 --> 02:20:13.590
mctavish: Like is it that hard.

1598
02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:20.700
Valerie Stoehr: That's. I mean, I've been imagining like having billboards, that kind of talk about

1599
02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:28.440
Valerie Stoehr: You know something, but you know like in 1944 you know like something about sugar rationing.

1600
02:20:28.980 --> 02:20:33.480
Valerie Stoehr: There's something about like no coffee for you know 18 months.

1601
02:20:33.720 --> 02:20:35.190
Valerie Stoehr: Mm hmm. You know, like

1602
02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:36.960

02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:41.220
Valerie Stoehr: won't put on a mask to walk into Starbucks and, you know,

1604
02:20:42.630 --> 02:20:44.790
