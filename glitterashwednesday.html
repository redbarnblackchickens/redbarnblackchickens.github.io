            <p>
                By being marked with ashes and glitter, we join with others who have articipated in the
                public
                witness of Glitter Ash Wednesday across
                the U.S., the U.K., and Canada since its beginnings in 2017.
            </p>
            <p>
                Glitter Ash Wednesday imagines a world of transformation, courage, and resistance and invites us all
                to
                bear
                the mark of inclusion and hope.
            </p>


            <h1>What is Glitter Ash Wednesday?</h1>

            <p>Glitter Ash Wednesday is a special type of Ash Wednesday service designed especially for
                the transgender and LGBTQ+
                community. Worshippers are offered a
                mixture of ashes and glitter (or only ashes, if they wish). They can choose to be marked
                on their forehead with a cross or, alternatively, a circle, symbolizing
                the circle of life and
                death.</p>
            <p> The ritual offers
                Christians an invitation to show up, or "come out," as faith affirming and LGBTQ+ affirming.</p>

            <h2>What does it mean?</h2>
            <p>The ritual captures the relationship between Ash Wednesday and Easter, which is the relationship
                between
                death and new life. In Glitter Ash Wednesday services the
                sparkle of glitter with ashes represents the mix of hope with the ashes of death. Ash with glitter
                shows
                that in these times of death-dealing forces such as racial injustice and white supremacy,
                unimaginable
                wealth inequality, and climate crisis, we reject despair and look to light and hope. </p>
            <p>
                This event is not a critique of traditional Ash Wednesday rituals or services. The ritual is
                centered on
                the LBGTQ+ community in recognition that many Christian traditions have attempted to exclude the LGBTQ+
                community from
                Christianity or have perpetrated harm against that community. Glitter Ash Wednesday also proudly
                stands in the long
                tradition of Christians who
                have fought righteously for the liberation of oppressed people. With this ritual we joyfully claim the
                power of radical inclusivity, and the power of allies standing in solidarity with targeted communities,
                in making change.</p>

            <p> All people are welcome to be part of this event. Participants need not be Christian or LGBTQIA to
                participate.
            </p>

            <!-- <h2>Why glitter?</h2>
            <p>
                Glitter is an inextricable element of queer history. It is how we have always
                displayed our gritty, scandalous
                hope. We make ourselves fabulously conspicuous, giving offense to the arbiters of respectability
                that
                allow
                coercive power to flourish.
            </p> -->

            <h2>Consider choosing a Lenten action</h2>
            <p>
                Ash Wednesday is the beginning of the season of Lent. It’s common for people to &#8220;give
                something
                up&#8221;
                for Lent. It
                is also entirely appropriate to take something on for Lent. Usually this is called a Lenten
                Discipline.
            </p>
            <p> Because
                Glitter Ash Wednesday is all about stepping up, you can commit to a Lenten Action: a specific
                action, chosen by you, to promote resurrection. You can choose to put energy into a cause that
                promotes
                life and health in the face of death-dealing forces in our world. </p>
            <!-- <p>The action you choose is your choice. No one
                is
                going to check up on you. This isn’t about solving all the world’s problems at once, but simply
                identifying
                what
                you choose to put your energy into right now.
            </p> -->

            <h2>Who can participate?</h2>
            <p>All trans-positive and queer-positive people who value inclusive Christianity are welcome. You do not
                need to be Christian or a member of
                the LGBTQ+ community to participate.</p>
