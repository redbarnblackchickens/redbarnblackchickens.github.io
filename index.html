                <h2>Afton/St. Croix Valley Policing Series</h2>

                <p>Against the backdrop of a national
                    focus on policing, Afton Indivisible takes a local look at
                    policing and mental
                    health in our
                    community. </p>

                <h2>A conversation with Washington County Sheriff Dan Starry</h2>
                <p>What is the police response to mental health crises in our community? What are local policing
                    priorities? At our July 2021 meeting we spoke with Washington County Sheriff
                    Dan Starry about crisis intervention training, opioid reentry programs, and more in a look at
                    policing in our community.</p>

                <p>Afton Indivisible member Lucia Wroblewski served over 28 years as a St. Paul police officer and
                    has a passion for good policing. At our June 2021 meeting she presented an inside look at coaching
                    St. Paul police to
                    deescalating mental health crises.</p>
