            <h1>What is Glitter Ash Wednesday?</h1>

            <p>Glitter Ash Wednesday is a special type of Ash Wednesday service created by and especially for
                the transgender and LGBTQ+
                community and allies. Worshippers are offered a
                mixture of ashes and glitter (or only ashes, if desired). You can be marked
               with a cross or, alternatively, a circle, symbolizing
                the circle of life and
                death.</p>
            <p> The ritual offers
                Christians an invitation to show up, or &#8220;come out,&#8221; as faith affirming and LGBTQ+ affirming.</p>

                <p>&#8220;Glitter Ash Wednesday beckons me to a Christian practice that is not only affirming of LGBTQ folks, but open to being changed by joining with them in Sacred Community,&#8221; says 
                    Rev. Michael Le Buhn Jr. of Hastings, MN, a co-organizer of the event.</p>

            <h2>What does it mean?</h2>
            <p>The ritual captures the relationship between Ash Wednesday and Easter, which is the relationship
                between
                death and new life. In Glitter Ash Wednesday services, the
                sparkle of glitter with ashes represents the mix of hope with the ashes of death. Ash with glitter
                shows
                that in these times of death-dealing forces such as racial injustice and white supremacy,
                unimaginable
                wealth inequality, and climate crisis, we reject despair and look to light and hope. </p>
            <p>
               <!-- <p>
                    Glitter Ash Wednesday embraces the power and solemnity of traditional Ash Wednesday rituals and is not a
                    critique
                    of those traditions. Glitter Ash Wednesday centers
                    the LGBTQ+ community in the ritual, recognizing that many Christian traditions have attempted to
                    exclude that community from Christianity or have perpetrated harm against LGBTQ+ people. When we
                    participate in Glitter Ash Wednesday, we stand with Christians who unequivocally affirm that all of us, including all transgender, 
                    nonbinary, and LGBTQ+ members of our community, 
                    are wholly sacred and fully welcome to participate in the life of the church. With this ritual we
                    joyfully claim the power of radical inclusivity and of allies standing in solidarity with
                    targeted communities.

                    <p>&#8220;As allies of the LGBTQI+ community, we believe that our worship can be both a continuation of 
                        traditional sacred practices and welcoming and affirming of all at the same time,&#8221; says co-organizer 
                        Pastor Steve Robertson of First Presbyterian Church in Hastings, MN.</p>

                    <p>Glitter Ash Wednesday joyfully claims the power of radical inclusivity and of allies standing in solidarity with
                        targeted communities. &#8220;When we
                        participate in Glitter Ash Wednesday,&#8221; says co-organizer Valerie Stoehr of Afton Indivisible, &#8220;we stand with Christians who unequivocally affirm that all of us, including transgender, 
                        nonbinary, and LGBTQ+ people, 
                        are wholly sacred and fully welcome to participate in the life of the church.&#8221;</p>
              

            <h2>Consider choosing a Lenten action</h2>
            <p>
                Ash Wednesday is the beginning of the season of Lent. It&#8217;s common for people to &#8220;give
                something
                up&#8221;
                for Lent. It
                is also entirely appropriate to take something on for Lent. Usually this is called a Lenten
                Discipline.
            </p>
            <p> Because
                Glitter Ash Wednesday is all about stepping up, you can commit to a Lenten Action: a specific
                action, chosen by you, to promote resurrection. You can choose to put energy into a cause that
                promotes
                life and health in the face of death-dealing forces in our world. </p>
            <!-- <p>The action you choose is your choice. No one
                is
                going to check up on you. This isnâ€™t about solving all the worldâ€™s problems at once, but simply
                identifying
                what
                you choose to put your energy into right now.
