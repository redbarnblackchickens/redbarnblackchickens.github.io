                </h3>

                <p>Afton Indivisible is coordinating a coalition of local and statewide organizations that will
                    gather
                    to show love and support for
                    transgender, non-binary, and LGBTQ+ children. A rally will be held at the Rotary Pavilion in
                    Levee
                    Park, 20 Ramsey Street, in Hastings, on Saturday, December 4th from 1 to 2 p.m. The public is
                    encouraged to attend to hear speakers, share support, and call on city leaders to denounce
                    bigotry
                    and transphobia in Hastings.</p>
                <p>The rally is in direct response to the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/44za7h39">recent national news
                    </a>that Hastings School Board Chair Kelsey Waits was
                    bullied and harassed throughout her recent bid for re-election. These attacks went well beyond
                    the
                    typical criticism and scrutiny that elected officials often face. Kelsey’s youngest child, a
                    second-grader, was outed as transgender by a local group of parents who had activated around the
                    election.</p>
                <p>Afton Indivisible stands with trans kids and their families. Attacks on families for political gain
                    are off
                    limits and cannot be part of civil discourse.</p>

                <p> We will not be divided by attacks against anyone’s family or anyone’s kids &mdash; no exceptions,
                    trans and nonbinary and LGBTQ kids included.</p>
                <p> We reject division, hate, and fear-mongering and are rallying to show we embrace kindness, respect,
                    and civil discourse. </p>
                <p>Expected attendees and supporters include Hastings Progressives; RECLAIM; ACLU of Minnesota; Afton
                    Indivisible; St. Croix Valley Indivisible; Indivisible St. Paul; MN Indivisible Alliance; Hastings
                    THRIVE; IDEA: Inclusion, Diversity & Equality Alliance; Transforming Families; Hastings civic,
                    business, non-profit, and faith leaders; and more. </p>
