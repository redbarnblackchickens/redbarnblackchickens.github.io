		<h3>Upcoming Events: The Afton/St. Croix Valley Policing Series</h3>
		<h4>A Local Look at Policing and Mental Health</h4>
		<p>Against the background of a national and statewide focus on policing, we look at policing in our
			community. Our series begins with conversations about policing and mental health policy and practices. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Crisis Intervention Training for Cops</p>
				<p>Afton Indivisible member Lucia Wroblewski served over 28 years as a St. Paul police officer and has a
					passion for good policing.
					She'll give
					us an inside look at
					the training she delivers to St. Paul police about deescalating mental health crises.</p>
				<p> Thursday, June 3, at 6:30 pm</p> <a>Register for Zoom event</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>A conversation with Washington County Sheriff Dan Starry</p>
				<p>What is the police response to mental health crises in our community? Who sets policing priorities,
					and
					how can we engage with them? Learn more about these topics and crisis intervention training, opioid
					reentry programs, and more in a conversation with Sheriff Dan Starry.
