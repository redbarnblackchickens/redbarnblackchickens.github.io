        <h2>Upcoming Events</h2>

        <h3>On March 2, Glitter and Ashes Show Support for the LGBTQ+ Community</h3>
        <p><strong>Glitter Ash Wednesday</strong> is a special type of Ash Wednesday service designed especially for
            the trans and LGBTQ+
            community. On March 2, multiple Glitter Ash Wednesday services and locations in the Hastings area will
            offer
            worshippers a mixture of ashes and glitter (or only ashes, if desired). The ritual offers queer and
            queer-positive
            Christians an invitation to show up, or "come out," as faith affirming and LGBTQ+ affirming.</p>
        <!-- <p>The ritual captures the relationship between Ash Wednesday and Easter, which is the relationship between
            death and new life. In Glitter Ash Wednesday services, which have occurred nationwide since 2017, the
            sparkle of glitter with ashes represents the mix of hope with the ashes of death. Ash with glitter shows
            that in these times of death-dealing forces such as racial injustice, white supremacy, and unimaginable
            wealth inequality, we reject despair and look to light and hope. </p> -->
        <p>
            Glitter Ash Wednesday embraces the power and solemnity of traditional Ash Wednesday rituals and is not a
            critique of those traditions. Glitter Ash Wednesday centers the LBGTQ+ community in the ritual, recognizing
            that many Christian traditions have attempted to exclude queer people from Christianity or have
            perpetrated harm against the LGBTQ+ community. Glitter Ash Wednesday also proudly stands in the long
            tradition of Christians who have fought righteously for the liberation of oppressed people. With this ritual
            we joyfully claim the power of radical inclusivity and the power of allies standing in solidarity with
            targeted communities.
        </p>
        <p>Detail about the times and locations of Glitter Ash Wednesday services are coming soon. </p>

        <h2>Past Events</h2>


        <h3>"Spotlight on Democracy" Rally at the MN Capitol</h3>
        <p> On January 6, 2022, with temperatures well below zero, we with joined with over a
            hundred Twin Cities Indivisible activists and friends at the Minnesota Capitol for a
            nationwide night
            focused on democracy and upholding the right to vote. </p>
        <p>This event was one of over 200 across the country to advocate for the passage of voting
            rights legislation. </p>



        <h3>Rally to Support Transgender Kids</h3>
        <p>In December 2021 Afton Indivisible coordinated a coalition of local and statewide organizations to
            show
            love and support for
            transgender, non-binary, and LGBTQ+ children at a rally in nearby Hastings, MN, that drew 900
            people.
        </p>
        <p>The rally was a direct response to the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/44za7h39">recent national news
            </a>that Hastings School Board Chair Kelsey Waits was
            bullied and harassed throughout her recent bid for re-election. </p>
        <p> We will not be divided by attacks against anyone’s family or anyone’s kids &mdash; no exceptions,
            trans and nonbinary and LGBTQ kids included.</p>
        <p> We reject division, hate, and fear-mongering and rallied to show we embrace kindness, respect,
            and civil discourse. </p>
        <p>You can watch a recording of the <a href="https://youtu.be/vPF3LAY-13w?t=1">Rally for Trans Kids</a>
            on the Hastings Community YouTube channel.</p>



        <h3>Afton/St. Croix Valley Policing Series</h3>
        <p>In addition to organizing, voter education, and get-out-the-vote efforts, Afton Indivisible is taking
            a local look at
            policing and mental
            health in our
            community. </p>
        <h4>A conversation with Washington County Sheriff Dan Starry</h4>
        <p>What is the police response to mental health crises in our community? What are local policing
            priorities? We spoke with Washington County Sheriff
            Dan Starry about crisis intervention training, opioid reentry programs, and support for mental
            health resources in our community.</p>
        <h4>Crisis Intervention Training for Cops</h4>
        <p>Afton Indivisible member Lucia Wroblewski served over 28 years as a St. Paul police officer and
            has a passion for good policing. She presented an inside look at coaching
            St. Paul police to
            deescalating mental health crises.</p>
