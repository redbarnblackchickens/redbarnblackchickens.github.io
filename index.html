            <h2>Rally to Support Transgender Kids</h2>



            <p>In December 2021 Afton Indivisible coordinated a coalition of local and statewide organizations to show
                love and support for
                transgender, non-binary, and LGBTQ+ children at a rally in nearby Hastings, MN, that drew 900 people.
            </p>
            <p>The rally was a direct response to the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/44za7h39">recent national news
                </a>that Hastings School Board Chair Kelsey Waits was
                bullied and harassed throughout her recent bid for re-election. </p>

            <p> We will not be divided by attacks against anyone’s family or anyone’s kids &mdash; no exceptions,
                trans and nonbinary and LGBTQ kids included.</p>
            <p> We reject division, hate, and fear-mongering and rallied to show we embrace kindness, respect,
                and civil discourse. </p>

                <h2>Afton/St. Croix Valley Policing Series</h2>

                <p>Against the backdrop of a national
                    focus on policing, Afton Indivisible takes a local look at
                    policing and mental
                    health in our
                    community. </p>
                <p>In addition to organizing, voter education, and get-out-the-vote efforts, here's some of what
                    we've
                    been up to.</p>

                    priorities? We spoke with Washington County Sheriff
                    Dan Starry about crisis intervention training, opioid reentry programs, and support for mental

                    has a passion for good policing. She presented an inside look at coaching
                    St. Paul police to
                    deescalating mental health crises.</p>
