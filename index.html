                <h3>March 2 is Glitter Ash Wednesday in Hastings</h3>

                <p><strong>Glitter Ash Wednesday</strong> started in 2017 as an opportunity for queer and queer-positive
                    Christians to celebrate the inclusion of trans
                    and LGBTQ+ people in their faith traditions.</p>
                <p> “<strong>Glitter Ash Wednesday</strong> shows that despite the message of hate LGBT people hear from
                    some
                    religious people, there are many more who love LGBT people, welcome them to their churches,
                    and
                    affirm their spiritual gifts,” <a
                        href="https://religionnews.com/2020/02/25/christian-leaders-show-love-for-lgbt-people-with-glitter-ashes-this-ash-wednesday/">says
                        Rev. Marian Edmonds-Allen</a>, Executive Director of Parity,
                    the
                    organizer of <strong>Glitter Ash Wednesday</strong>. “It is a way to ‘come out’ as an affirming
                    Christian.”

                <h2>"Spotlight on Democracy" Rally at the MN Capitol</h2>

                <p> On January 6, 2022, with temperatures well below zero, we with joined with over a
                    hundred Twin Cities Indivisible activists and friends at the Minnesota Capitol for a
                    nationwide night
                    focused on democracy and upholding the right to vote. </p>
                <p>This event was one of over 200 across the country to advocate for the passage of voting
                    rights legislation. </p>

                <h2>Rally to Support Transgender Kids</h2>



                <p>In December 2021 Afton Indivisible coordinated a coalition of local and statewide organizations to
                    show
                    love and support for
                    transgender, non-binary, and LGBTQ+ children at a rally in nearby Hastings, MN, that drew 900
                    people.
                </p>
                <p>The rally was a direct response to the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/44za7h39">recent national news
                    </a>that Hastings School Board Chair Kelsey Waits was
                    bullied and harassed throughout her recent bid for re-election. </p>

                <p> We will not be divided by attacks against anyone’s family or anyone’s kids &mdash; no exceptions,
                    trans and nonbinary and LGBTQ kids included.</p>
                <p> We reject division, hate, and fear-mongering and rallied to show we embrace kindness, respect,
                    and civil discourse. </p>

                <p>Against the backdrop of a national
