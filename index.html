		<div class="content">
			<p>In 2020, Valerie Stoehr began a series of works that use code&#8212;HTML and CSS, the language of the web&#8212;to explore constructs of power, gender, and spirituality.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>   <p>Stoehr's first series, <cite>Beasts and Serpents</cite>, reimagines a child's toy and considers the role of toys in shaping a child's understanding of the world. The work is based on the traditional toy that children manipulate to display an imaginary creatures from interchangeable images of the upper, middle, and lower parts of animals.
				</p></li>
				<li><p>Stoehr's second series, <a href="sampler.html"><cite>Samplers</cite></a>, juxtaposes hand-worked needlework samplers with a coding alphabet and the concept of semantic structure. In traditional stitched samplers, each letter of the alphabet is often portayed in a matrix, and additional symbols or representations of landscape and culture may appear. Stoehr's digital tapestries similarly expose the function and raw beauty of code and information architecture among elements of a digital landscape.</p></li>

				<li><p>The third series, <a href="meetinghouse.html"><cite>In the Meetinghouse</cite></a>, references Stoehr's Quaker experience. Digital structures defined by code suggest the physical configuration in which Quakers assemble to meet for worship. Within those defined structures, objects transform over time and in relationship to each other. The work reflects on the fluid, multidimensional, and ultimately experiential components of a Quaker gathering for worship.          
				</p></li>
				<li><p><cite>Olmsted County</cite>, in contrast to earlier explorations of play, considers  work and its complicated relationship with leisure and play. With a restrained digital vocabulary and an explosion of matricies, Stoehr uses pattern and repetition to propose a digital statement of midwestern aesthetics, experience, and culture. </p>
					<li><p>The <a href="wadena.html"><cite>Wadena County</cite></a> series marks Stoehr's turn to pairing physical objects with digital pieces. The first set of work is based on a plat map drawn by Stoehr's grandfather. The second series incorporates a barn beam from Stoehr's Finnish-American grandparent's homestead in Sebeka, Minnesota. The physical and digital pieces explore <a href="access.html">accessibility</a>, the rules of information design, and both the beauty and the ill fit of the grid on the landscape and psyche.
					</p></li>
				</ul>



				<p>Stoehr earned a women's studies degree from the University of Minnesota. In 1985 she moved to Oakland, CA, and began a career in the tech industry, documenting and designing emerging technologies. She now resides in Afton, MN.</p>
