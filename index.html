                <h2>On March 2, Glitter and Ashes Show Support for the LGBTQ+ Community</h2>


                <p>Wednesday, March 2nd, is <strong>Glitter+Ash Wednesday</strong> in Hastings, MN. </p>
                <p> Multiple Ash Wednesday
                    services
                    will
                    offer worshippers a mixture of ashes and glitter (or only ashes) to signify support for the
                    full inclusion of trans and LGBTQ+ people in those faith traditions. </p>
                <p> In Glitter+Ash Wednesday services, which have occurred nationwide since 2017, the sparkle of glitter
                    with ashes represents
                    the mix of hope with the ashes of death. Ash with glitter shows that in these times of death-dealing
                    forces such as racial injustice, unimaginable
                    wealth inequality, and climate crisis, we look to light and
                    hope.
                </p>
                <p>Detail about the times and locations of Glitter+Ash Wednesday services are coming soon. All are
                    welcome to participate.</p>

                <h2>"Spotlight on Democracy" Rally at the MN Capitol</h2>

                <p> On January 6, 2022, with temperatures well below zero, we with joined with over a
                    hundred Twin Cities Indivisible activists and friends at the Minnesota Capitol for a
                    nationwide night
                    focused on democracy and upholding the right to vote. </p>
                <p>This event was one of over 200 across the country to advocate for the passage of voting
                    rights legislation. </p>

                <h2>Rally to Support Transgender Kids</h2>



                <p>In December 2021 Afton Indivisible coordinated a coalition of local and statewide organizations to
                    show
                    love and support for
                    transgender, non-binary, and LGBTQ+ children at a rally in nearby Hastings, MN, that drew 900
                    people.
                </p>
                <p>The rally was a direct response to the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/44za7h39">recent national news
                    </a>that Hastings School Board Chair Kelsey Waits was
                    bullied and harassed throughout her recent bid for re-election. </p>

                <p> We will not be divided by attacks against anyone’s family or anyone’s kids &mdash; no exceptions,
                    trans and nonbinary and LGBTQ kids included.</p>
                <p> We reject division, hate, and fear-mongering and rallied to show we embrace kindness, respect,
                    and civil discourse. </p>
                <p>You can watch a recording of the <a href="https://youtu.be/vPF3LAY-13w?t=1">Rally for Trans Kids</a>

                    priorities? We spoke with Washington County Sheriff
                    Dan Starry about crisis intervention training, opioid reentry programs, and support for mental
