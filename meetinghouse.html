<h3>Where my head is at, 1/23/21</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>I like the hand-dawn quality of my PowerPoint sketches (sketches 1-13), created from using my stylus on my tablet (my land-time mouse replacement). I hate giving that up, but those organic lines aren't really part of the HTML/CSS/JS palette. I looked at articles about how to create more hand-drawn-looking lines in <a href="http://perfectionkills.com/exploring-canvas-drawing-techniques/">Canvas</a> or <a href="https://heredragonsabound.blogspot.com/2020/02/creating-pencil-effect-in-svg.html">SVG</a> or <a href="https://roughjs.com/">otherwise.</a>..but that is such a rabbit hole, and it's not really the world I'm good at. Makes me question, again, why to do this online if I don't want the palette of what's online. Can I build a damn printing press in the kitchen and use cranberries for ink and add texture with the sewing machine? Maybe think about my drawings as proof sheets. Back to the printers marks. Or fucking embrace PowerPoint and my Wacom tablet.</li>
    <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y03RE.jpg" width="30px">
    <li>I stripped out all styles. I need to build from a blank page and from the ground up. I need a deep dive to remind myself how to do so many things. I'm just not at all fluent yet with being able to quickly establish margins and text line length, alignments, relationships between the elements, etc. I want to invest in this more than I want to invest in how to create a fake pencil line.</li>
    <li>I like my sketches. I like what they suggest. Additionally, being so limited in the tools I feel adept at using is forcing me to make creative decisions that exploit powerpoint and a pencil versus HTML/CSS. Next I believe I need to make sketches on blank HTML pages. Play with the barest elements of that, maybe just the suggestion of the grid on the page, to build up my competency and fluency with the canvas/palette.</li>
    <li>This exercise also makes me think about the book. Articles. I don't want fake pencil lines; I want an interesting series of work. Not necessarily essays and long-form writing, but staying in the landscape of articles that make up a whole.</li>
    
</ul>

<h3>Week one sketches, including notes made as part of the process</h3>

 <ul>
  <li>Why digital? Why not a drawing, essay, print? What can I do online that makes this make sense online?</li> 
  <li>Use of article tags...how to make that work.</li>
  <li>Use figure tags?</li> 
  <li>Specificity. Specificity of my experience, this particular meetinghouse, this particular community of Quakers in this time. Can document hearing other Friends, but this is a first-person document. [Witches memorial and its first-person accounts.]</li>  
 <li>Can this be like the filmstrip we made in elementary school, where I drew on the white piece of film and we watched those lines dance when we put it in the projector? Same sense of the progression of time in old-style filmstrip style?</li>
  <li>Color palette of the tech. writer and printer. Black and white, with orange-tinted red.</li>
   <li>Being a recording clerk for the meeting...that sense of documentation.</li>
    <li>My book about how to read tea leaves has a series of plates that show a simple black and white line drawing of a teacup from above, with the pattern of leaves in the cup, and accompanying text explanations/decodings. Do that time of thing. Repetitive icon image with shifts from one to the next, with explanations as needed.</li>
    <li>I like the subversive aspsect of using canvas. Animation may be useful, although I like the guy who said the shapes themselves become more interesting, and the suggestion of animation, versus the actual animation. I like taking the element that's used for shoot-em-up scoring games and documenting a Quaker meeting. I like that it grounds me in play. I like 2D, I need 2D. And stacking multiple canvases and figuring out what's there to exploit could be interesting. But it probably pulls me in a direction that's a diversion from where I want to be.</li>

  <p>A rectangle with a black border. In the background is a pink circle. Partially overlaying the

  Partially overlaying the circle is a green

  and a purple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle" onfocus="drawTriangle();" onblur="drawPicture();">triangle</a>, 
  both of which are semi-opaque, so the full circle can be seen underneath.</p>
