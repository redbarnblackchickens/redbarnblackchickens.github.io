		<h1>In the Meetinghouse: Sketches</h1>

    <ul>
  <li>Why digital? Why not a drawing, essay, print? What can I do online that makes this make sense online?</li> 
  <li>Use of article tags...how to make that work.</li>
  <li>Use figure tags?</li> 
  <li>Specificity. Specificity of miy experience, this particular meetinghouse, this particular community of Quakers in this time. Can document hearing other Friends, but seems I wan to make this a first-person document. [Witches memorial and its first-person accounts.]</li>  
 <li>Can this be like the filmstrip we made in elementary school, where I drew on the white piece of film and we watched those lines dance when we put it in the projector? Same sense of the progression of time in old-style filmstrip style?</li>
  <li>Color palette of the tech. writer and printer. Black and white, with orange-tinted red.</li>
   <li>Being a recording clerk for the meeting...that sense of documentation.</li>
    <li>My book about how to read tea leaves has a series of plates that show a simple black and white line drawing of a teacup from above, with the pattern of leaves in the cup, and accompanying text explanations/decodings. Do that time of thing. Repetitive icon image with shifts from one to the next, with explanations as needed.</li>
     <li>There's a subversive aspect to using the html canvas element that could be appealing. Animation may be useful, although I like the guy who said the shapes themselves become more interesting, and the suggestion of animation, versus the actual animation. But to take this element that's used for shoot-em-up scoring games and document a Quaker meeting...I like that. And I like that it grounds me in play. And I really want the 2D nature. And stacking multiple canvases and figuring out what's there to exploit could be interesting. That said, it doesn't help me learn more about html and css. But I could get less intimidated by JS.</li>

<canvas id="example" width="260" height="200">
	<h2>Shapes</h2>
  <p>A rectangle with a black border. In the background is a pink circle. Partially overlaying the 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle" onfocus="drawCircle();" onblur="drawPicture();">circle</a>. 
  Partially overlaying the circle is a green 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square" onfocus="drawSquare();" onblur="drawPicture();">square</a> 
  and a purple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle" onfocus="drawTriangle();" onblur="drawPicture();">triangle</a>, 
  both of which are semi-opaque, so the full circle can be seen underneath.</p>
