<h3>Notes, 1/23/21</h3>
   <ul>

 <li><p>I like the hand-dawn quality of my PowerPoint sketches (sketches 1&#8288;&#8211;&#8288;13), created from using my stylus (my long-time mouse replacement). I hate giving up the organic quality of these lines in a shift to the look of what HTML and CSS typically produce. I looked at articles about how to create more hand-drawn-looking lines in <a href="http://perfectionkills.com/exploring-canvas-drawing-techniques/">Canvas</a> or <a href="https://heredragonsabound.blogspot.com/2020/02/creating-pencil-effect-in-svg.html">SVG</a> or <a href="https://roughjs.com/">otherwise.</a>..but that is such a rabbit hole, and it's not really the world I'm good at. Makes me question, again, why to do this online if I don't want the palette of what's online. Build a printing press in the kitchen and use cranberries for ink and add texture with the sewing machine. Think about my drawings as proof sheets and use printers' marks. Or screw it, embrace PowerPoint and my Wacom tablet.</p></li>

<li><p>I stripped out most styles [then relented and put some back in, but it's a bit haphazard.] Instead of messing around with this, I'm pushing that work to next week, in  the next set of steps. I need to build from a blank page and from the ground up. I need a deep dive to remind myself how to do the things I want to do. I'm not yet fluent at being able to quickly establish margins and text line length, alignment, relationships between the elements, and so on. I want to invest in this more than I want to invest in how to create a fake pencil line.</p></li>

<li><p>I like my sketches. I like what they suggest. Additionally, being so limited in the tools with which I feel adept is forcing me to make creative decisions that exploit PowerPoint and a pencil versus HTML/CSS. And I want, instead, to be able to more freely choose what I want on the palette.</p></li>

<li><p>This article makes me think about the book. Articles. I don't want fake pencil lines; I want an interesting series of work. Not necessarily essays and long-form writing, but staying in the landscape of articles that make up a whole.</p></li>
<li><p>Why digital? Why not a drawing, essay, print? What can I do online that makes this make sense online?</li> 
<li><p>Use of the article tag.</p></li>
<li><p>I want each sketch to be its own page, and I know that navigation is a PITA. It's not quick for me to place them in a flexbox or grid, and I didn't divert time to do that. Thinking about whether to make this like a book, and how to do that, etc., is for future sketches and prototypes.</p></li>
<li><p>Specificity. Specificity of my experience, this particular meetinghouse, this particular community of Quakers in this time. Can document hearing other Friends, but this is a first-person document. [Witches memorial and its first-person accounts.]</p></li>  
<li><p>Reference the film created by drawing on the white piece of film, just as we did in elementary school. Same sense of the progression of time as in that old-style filmstrip.</p></li>
<li><p>Color palette of the tech. writer and printer. Black and white, with orange-tinted red.</p></li>
<li><p>Being a recording clerk for the meeting...that sense of documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>My book about how to read tea leaves has a series of plates that show a simple black and white line drawing of a teacup from above, with the pattern of leaves in the cup, and accompanying text explanations/decodings. Do that time of thing. Repetitive icon image with shifts from one to the next, with explanations as needed.</p></li>
<li><p>I like the subversive aspsect of using canvas. Animation may be useful, although I like the guy who said the shapes themselves become more interesting, and the suggestion of animation, versus the actual animation. I like taking the element that's used for shoot-em-up scoring games and documenting a Quaker meeting. I like that it grounds me in play. I like 2D, I need 2D. And stacking multiple canvases and figuring out what's there to exploit could be interesting. But it probably pulls me in a direction that's a diversion from where I want to be.</p></li>
<li><p>Next steps: Sketches of the empty html page, and make small alterations.</p></li>
