<h3>Notes, 1/29/21 through 2/5/21</h3>
   <ul>

 
<li><p>At grandma and grandpa's house, after the part where the women have washed the dishes and the men gather in the living room, now that the card game has started in the kitchen, you lie down on the carpeted living room floor or sprawl on the sofa because your uncle has finished napping there, and you pull out the plat map from the shelf under the end table. You find grandma and grandpa's house. You see which names you know in the squares that mark ownership. You figure out where the church is who owns the land between  the church  and the cow pasture. That's the cow pasture east of the house, on the other side of the barbed wire and electric fence, where you slip through and walk to the lower part where the water runs in the spring and where you where you climb the trees to stay out of reach from the cows, even though the cows don't care.</p>
  <p>Or, as you eat cornflakes and toast with jelly at the breakfast table and you look at arial photo of the farm on the wall, above the print of the photo of the gray-bearded man in the green plaid shirt praying over soup and bread.</p>
<p>Always the arial photo, always the plat map.</p></li>
<li>When my parents moved in the great rush of Covid and closing dates and a flurry of boxes, one of the boxes that's now in my basement holds a hand-drawn register of what I presume are Wadena county plats because I see Finnish names. The official record is in pencil! Cursive writing, in my recollection, though I need to go to the basement and verify. </li><p>
