<h3>Notes, 1/29/21 through 2/5/21</h3>
   <ul>

 
<li><p>Always the arial photo, always the plat map.</p>
  <p>At grandma and grandpa's house, after the part where the women have washed the dishes, now that the card game has started in the kitchen, you lie down on the carpeted living room floor or sprawl on the sofa because your uncle has finished napping there, and you pull out the plat map from the stack of books on the end table shelf. You find grandma and grandpa's house. You see which names you know in the squares that mark ownership. You find the intersection where the church is and where the general store used to be, and you see who owns the land between that intersection and the cow pasture. </p>
  <p>Or, as you eat cornflakes and toast with jelly at the breakfast table and you look at arial photo of the farm on the wall, above the print of the photo of the gray-bearded man in the green plaid shirt praying over soup and bread.</p>
</li>
<li>When my parents moved in the great rush of Covid and closing dates and a flurry of boxes, one of the boxes that's now in my basement holds a hand-drawn register of what I presume are Wadena county plats because I see Finnish names. The official record is in pencil! Cursive writing, in my recollection, though I need to go to the basement and verify. </li>
<li>I am seeing that I can focus on learning code or I can draw sketches, and they're very different worlds right now. It's slow going and consuming to set up pages because that is the core stuff that shouldn't be done incorrectly! I don't want to take short cuts.</li>
<li>At times I feel dumb: why is this taking so long, how can I not know how to do this? And then later I feel smart: Dang, I know the hard part, which is how to do the sketches from a design point of view. A light bulb went off as I watched Kevin Powell use css to set up a page, when he brought up the PhotoShop wireframe/rendering to work from. RIGHT! I was expecting to put the page together from a magic picture in my mind, when the way I've been working for years is to create the picture for the developers. Why should I skip that step now?</li>
<li>Carol sent me this <a href="https://mediacenter.as.ucsb.edu/author-kurt-vonnegut-on-learning-new-skills/#:~:text=Because%20I%20went%20from%20a,%E2%80%9CWin%E2%80%9D%20at%20them.%E2%80%9D">statement about learning new skills from UC Santa Barbara's media center page</a>, which is so perfect.</li>
<li>At the end of the week I signed up for Kevin Powell's <a href="https://courses.kevinpowell.co/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts"><cite>Conquering Responsive Layouts: 21-Day Challenge</cite></a> course. I want to be more skilled at preparing the canvas (generic use of the word, not the canvas html element). I want to be able to more easily do in html and css what I can do in PowerPoint. I think (?) this course is modeled on what I'm attempting to do in the samplers, though I'm still in the very baby steps of setting up the piece of paper and learning skills instead of being able to execute creatively. I've been watching Kevin's grid videos over the past week, and I like his approach and teaching style.</li>
<li>Themes from the past week: Grid syntax. Semantic structure. Using float only for its primary purpose. Avoid flexbox for now [almost]. Color contrast (except when I'm adding borders to elements to understand their behavior. Line length. Mobile first, and minimal code changes required for larger screens. Organization of css (sort of sketchy here). Structure of h1/h2 on the page has been surprisingly difficult. Remembering that tab order follows HTML order, so ensuring this makes sense for accessibility and responsive purposes; the tab order that looks correct at a larger size isn't necessarily what the actual tab order should be. </li>
<li>I'm going to switch from Sublime to VS Code and try that for a week. I haven't used the live server plugin for Sublime and instead of figuring out how to set it up, I'll go use the live server option in VS Code. I also really miss the auto-rearrangement/cleanup of code that CodePen does. Can I do that in VS Code? Can I do it in Sublime even though I haven't found that option? Sublime isn't exactly free, and I'm not sure I want to buy it.</li>
<li>I wonder whether the pen that goes with my iPad would work for anything. The one I bought when I quit my job, but that I couldn't easily figure out how to use and set aside. And when I asked at the Apple Store how to use it they told me to look at videos on YouTube. I thought $%^& you, I dragged my a$$ to the MOA Apple Store and that's your answer? Explore that next week.</li>
<li>I went to another of really good accessibility webinar presented by two people who work at the Center for Inclusive Design and Innovation. (Kathy, I don't think there's a recording available, but if I find one I'll share it with you.) Things to pay attention to:
  <ul>
    <li>Color contrast. Absolute minimum of 4.5:1. The AAA standard proposes a level that basically calls for black and white (7:1? can't remember offhand), which isn't practical. Good tools are supposedly Color Contrast Analyzer and Color Oracle. And supposedly we should make a dark mode available. Text over images typically fails. Pay attention to button label text in all modes. Even when something is disabled or unselected, people with low vision need to see it.</li>
    <li>Don't override browser settings that show selected items as you tab through the site.</li>
    <li>Add a skip-to-main-content option, and make certain the item it jumps to  shows visible focus. Remember that this is used by people with motor disabilities, not only people with screen readers, so visibility matters.</li>
    <li>Supposedly we should offer a dark-scheme mode. Recommended resources: Mozilla's <cite Contrast Mode</cite> article. W3CSchool's <cite>Dark Mode</cite> article.</li>
