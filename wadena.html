<h3>Notes, 2/6/21 through 2/12/21</h3>
   <ul>

 
<li>I found what I didn't know existed, a 1954 Wadena County Section 1 plat map in my grandfather's writing, in pencil. My grandfather's writing shows the plat for his father (my great-grandfather) August Mattila. My mom told me that my grandfather was the town clerk, and apparently that helps explain why this would be in my mom's posessions.</li>
<li>I've installed NVDA. I'm staggeringly slow at using it. But getting better.</li>
<li>For the zillionth time I'm studying the semantic HTML5 elements. I think at this point it's time to take a crack at it and not get too wrapped around the axel. After many years there is still controversy and some lack of clarity regarding best practices. For now, good enough will be good enough. I see validity regarding the argument that structured headings are useful, especially if we're going to style documents without losing our minds. Conceptually I understand that we can ignoring the heading level within articles, but that's divorced from real life to some degree.</li>
<li>I'm making progress through the 21-day responsive design curriculum and exercises. Feeling much more competent. Helps me recognize the progress I've made.</li>
<li>Slow progress again this week. Am focusing on fundamentals that will let me be more adept at translating pictures to html and css.</li>
<li>Tried using Visual Studio Code for an entire week but bailed when I couldn't figure out the live server option and returned to Sublime.</li>
<li>Got help from Kathy finding the reindent option in Subline. But why won't control-a work to select all text? It's listed a command, supposedly should work, but does't. </li>
<li>Adding divs is very new, and my brain doesn't think in divs. I'm accustomed to such strict semantic structures that didn't employ them. So in the 21-day-responsive-design-course challenges, I've stumbled when the obvious way to get all the elements to move away from the left side of the viewport is to wrap them with a div. Such cheating!</li>
<li>I'm doing what the class advises, which is to move slowly and get solid on the fundamentals of setting width (in percent, not pixels) and max-width (in pixels). Am avoiding setting font sizes in ems. Am getting solid about knowing I can use ems for paddings and margins, although sometimes rems is preferable. </li>
<li>Bit the bullet and installed a google font even though the typographers look down on that. And setting font weight with Roboto doesn't work...and the forums confirm that something is hosed. Am ignoring the problem.</li>
<li><p>I'm making very slow progress with regard to making more sketches. Am thinking about Ii, Finland, where my great-grandmother is from, and rereading what my mom has written about her history.</p>
<p>I became really frustrated last night after one too many people posted something on Facebook about their trip to Mexico, and another about their Texas vacations and airplane trips. And after one of the Quakers at business meeting wanted to know whether now the old people can meet there now that they've been vaccinated. I was talking with Gail and said damn it, my great grandmother Anna was born in 1850. When she was three her mother died in childbirth. Anna's father was later to lose two more wives, and 16 of his 24 children. This area of Finland traded salted salmon and dried codfish, furs, and tar for the shipbuilding industry. The year 3-year-old Anna lost her mother is the year the Crimean War began, and British and French ships attacked Finnish this area, destroying ships and setting fires to the tar supplies and to lumber supplies. Finland was not yet independent, and the British and French considered the Finns enemies because her ships sailed under the Russian flag.</p><p>And now in the 1860s Finland entered a decade of famine. About ten percent of the population died from starvation and disease. We learned that beggars roamed the countryside and people subsisted on tree bark mixed with flour, and soup made with reindeer moss and milk. The family story is that Anna wanted to share the family's meager amount of food with neighbors who had nothing, and that tensions arose between Anna and her stepmother. </p>
<p>The winter she was 18, Anna left home and skiied 400 miles to the portion of Norway that is north of Finland and on the Arctic Circle. You know it's bad when skiing 400 miles to the Arctic Ocean is your best option. At least there, people knew, there was fish. The stories are that frozen bodies of people who died aong the way lined the rivers that were these river routes.</li><p>Anna made it to a Finnish settlement in Norway (Vadso, Norway). She met and later married a man that was to die in a mine fire, in the UP's worse mining disaster, a tragedy perhaps made worse by the mining company's decision to seal the mine (close it, suffocating the fire and anyone underground) to save the underground wood timbers at the expense of the miners below.</p>
<p>So Anna was a young immigrant widow and made her way to Minnesota. Life there was not easy. My mom says it seems that demands were placed on Anna even late in her life. </p>
<p>So right now I feel furious at people who have no sense of proportion about what difficulty can look like. I also don't know how that informs using grid and the DOM in conjunction with a plat map and responsive design. I think it has to do with reindeer cut off from their migration paths by fences, and the cattle on that Sebeka farm, and probably the cinder block chicken coop in which my mother was born. I'll figure it out.</p>
  
</ul>

<h3>Goals from last week, which I'm working through</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure my pages can be successfully read by NVDA.</li>
    <li>Each day, make one more day of progress through the 28-day responsive design curriculum and exercises, assuming they are helpful.</li>
    <li>Learn enough to decide whether using the iPad pencil makes sense.</li>
    <li>Write more about my approach to the works. At least one more paragraph.</li>
    <li>Get out the plat map from the box of my parent's stuff and look at it again.</li>
    <li>Make more sketches. For now, get rid of canvas if it's too much to figure out what's going on with it. </li>
  </ul>
