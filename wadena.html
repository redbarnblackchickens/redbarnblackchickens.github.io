<h3>Notes: 2/6/21 through 2/12/21</h3>

<ul>
   <li>I found what I didn't know existed, a 1954 Wadena County Section 1 plat map in my grandfather's writing, in pencil. My grandfather's writing shows the plat for his father (my great-grandfather) August Mattila. My mom told me that my grandfather was the town clerk, and apparently that helps explain why this would be in my mom's posessions.</li>
   <li>I've installed NVDA. I'm staggeringly slow at using it. But getting better.</li>
   <li>For the zillionth time I'm studying the semantic HTML5 elements. I think at this point it's time to take a crack at it and not get too wrapped around the axel. After many years there is still controversy and some lack of clarity regarding best practices. For now, good enough will be good enough. I see validity regarding the argument that structured headings are useful, especially if we're going to style documents without losing our minds. Conceptually I understand that we can ignoring the heading level within articles, but that's divorced from real life to some degree.</li>
   <li>I'm making progress through the 21-day responsive design curriculum and exercises. Feeling much more competent. Helps me recognize the progress I've made.</li>
   <li>Slow progress again this week. Am focusing on fundamentals that will let me be more adept at translating pictures to html and css.</li>
   <li>Tried to use Visual Studio Code for an entire week, to help myself make a decision about whether I liked it enough to switch or whether I want to purchase Sublime. But I bailed when I couldn't figure out the live server option and returned to Sublime.</li>
   <li>Got help from Kathy finding the reindent option in Subline. But why won't control-a work to select all text? Control-a is listed as a valid command, but executing it fails to select all the text.</li>
   <li>Adding divs is very new, and my brain doesn't think in divs. I'm accustomed to such strict semantic structures that didn't employ them. So in the 21-day-responsive-design-course challenges, I've stumbled when the obvious way to get all the elements to move away from the left side of the viewport is to wrap them with a div. Such cheating! I think I am starting to make the switch conceptually.</li>
   <li>I'm doing what the [self-directed online] class advises, which is to move slowly and get sure-footed about certain fundamentals: setting width (in percent, not pixels), setting max-width (in pixels). Avoiding setting font sizes in ems, though using ems for setting margins and padding. Understanding when rems may be preferable. Setting <code>margin: 0 auto</code>. These are the basics of setting up the page that are helping me a lot. </li>
   <li>Bit the bullet and installed a google font even though the typographers look down on that. And whaddayaknow, setting font weight with Roboto doesn't work...and the forums confirm that something is hosed. Am ignoring the problem.</li>
   <li><p>I'm making very slow progress with regard to making more sketches. Am thinking about Ii, Finland, where my great-grandmother is from, and rereading what my mom has written about her history.</p>
    <p>I became really frustrated last night after hearing too many tales of friends or friends of friends vacationing in Mexico, traveling to Texas, vacationing in the Carribean. At Quaker meeting for business, Friends want to know whether old people can gather at the meetinghouse now that we're (presumably) vaccinated, or about to be vaccinated. I was talking with Gail and said damn it, my great grandmother Anna was born in 1850. When she was three her mother died in childbirth. Anna's father was later to lose two more wives, and 16 of his 24 children. The same year that 3-year-old Anna lost her mother is the same year the Crimean War began, and British and French ships attacked the area, destroying ships and setting fires. Finland was not yet independent, and she was considered an enemy because her ships sailed under the Russian flag.</p>
    <p>In Anna's childhood, in the 1860s, Finland entered a decade of famine. About ten percent of the population died from starvation and disease. My mom says she learned that beggars roamed the countryside and people subsisted on tree bark mixed with flour, and soup made with reindeer moss and milk.</p>

    <p>The winter she was 18, Anna left home and skiied 400 miles to the portion of Norway that is north of Finland and on the Arctic Circle. The family story is that Anna had wanted to share the family's meager amount of food with neighbors who had nothing, and that tensions had arisen between Anna and her stepmother. You know it's bad when skiing 400 miles to the Arctic Ocean is your best option. At least at the ocean, people knew, there was fish. The stories are that the routes to Norway along the frozen rivers were lined with the bodies of people who died en route.</p>
    <p>Anna made it to a Finnish settlement in Norway (Vadso, Norway). She met and later married another Finn who had traveled to Vadso from Sweden, presumably to escape the famine. This man was to later die in Michigan's worst mining disaster, an underground fire, and a tragedy made worse--so say the families of the dead, although the mining company denied it--by the mining company's decision to seal the mine. Sealing the mine closed it, suffocating the fire and anyone underground in an attempt to save the mine's wood timbers at the expense of the miners below. After losing her husband, Anna--now a young widow with children--buried her husband in an unmarked grave and made her way to Minnesota.</p>

    <p>I'm using that to inform using grid and the DOM in conjunction with a plat map and responsive design, I'm just not sure exactly how. My anger about Covid responses is tied up on this. This has to do with reindeer cut off from their migration paths by fences, and cattle on that Sebeka farm, and genocide that drove out bison, and probably the cinder block chicken coop in which my mother was born. Also the anti-immigrant rant I saw recently in my extended family. Maybe those Finnish streams and the bodies that lined them. I'll figure it out.</p></li>
    <li>The morning of February 11th is my breakthrough moment: Use of the css grid-template declaration virtually eliminates the need for bastardized divs to handle layout! Yes! I can throw those damn stupid divs, the ones used for solely for the purpose of column layouts and so on, overboard! I have learned, courtesy of feeling stupid in many monents and working working working on this, that there is a beautiful marriage between semantically structured pages and css grid! Hallelujah.</li>
    <li>Also, screw google fonts and their bugginess. What's not to love about <code>font-family:serif</code>. And come to think of it, is there something unseemly about Google distributing free fonts? Are they busy destroying the craft of typography?</li>
    <li>I love the blank boxes on the plat map. They're the best ones. I see the neat boxes with names, one after another...and then a box with an irregular blue pencilled line running through it, and a black pencilled line roughly parallel to it that my mom thinks may show the change in the river's course. And then, where the river leaks into the box to the southeast, that box on the plat map is completely empty, save for the short line my grandfather drew that shows that river leaking into that box. No name in that box. No numbers, no cryptic codes that mark the other plats, no red dashed line connecting its ownership to a neighboring box. Just nothing. The township doesn't have anything to say about this square. The language of the plat map has nothing to offer. </li>
    <li>Results from screen reader use are about what I expected, although I see that I forgot that HTML order is reading order, and I shouldn't trick the screen reader by placing an h2 in the header and an h1 after it, in a semantically separate element. I should have used CSS to accomplish that, or probably a nav element within a header rather than the h2.</li>
    <li>It's more slow going. I know I'm making progress, but it takes a very long time toe get the point of being able to make progress. Sketches are slow in coming, but I think I'm staying with the heart of them.</li>
  </ul>


<h3>Goals, 6/21 through 2/12/21</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure my pages can be successfully read by NVDA.</li>
  <li>Each day, make one more day of progress through the 28-day responsive design curriculum and exercises, assuming they are helpful.</li>
  <li>Learn enough to decide whether using the iPad pencil makes sense. Decided in the call with Kathy that a pencil or pen and paper is enough; I may not complete this goal right now.</li>
  <li>Write more about my approach to the works. At least one more paragraph.</li>
  <li>Get out the plat map from the box of my parent's stuff and look at it again.</li>
  <li>Make more sketches. For now, get rid of canvas if it's too much to figure out what's going on with it. </li>
</ul>
