<h3>Notes, 2/6/21 through 2/12/21</h3>
   <ul>

 
<li>I found what I didn't know existed, a 1954 Wadena County Section 1 plat map in my grandfather's writing, in pencil. My grandfather's writing shows the plat for his father (my great-grandfather) August Mattila. My mom told me that my grandfather was the town clerk, and apparently that helps explain why this would be in my mom's posessions.</li>
<li>I've installed NVDA. I'm staggeringly slow at using it. But getting better.</li>
<li>For the zillionth time I'm studying the semantic HTML5 elements. I think at this point it's time to take a crack at it and not get too wrapped around the axel. After many years there is still controversy and some lack of clarity regarding best practices. For now, good enough will be good enough. I see validity regarding the argument that structured headings are useful, especially if we're going to style documents without losing our minds. Conceptually I understand that we can ignoring the heading level within articles, but that's divorced from real life to some degree.</li>
<li>I'm making progress through the 21-day responsive design curriculum and exercises. Feeling much more competent. Helps me recognize the progress I've made.</li>
<li>Slow progress again this week. Am focusing on fundamentals that will let me be more adept at translating pictures to html and css.</li>
<li>Tried to use Visual Studio Code for an entire week, to help myself make a decision about whether I liked it enough to switch or whether I want to purchase Sublime. But I bailed when I couldn't figure out the live server option and returned to Sublime.</li>
<li>Got help from Kathy finding the reindent option in Subline. But why won't control-a work to select all text? Control-a is listed as a valid command, but executing it fails to select all the text.</li>
<li>Adding divs is very new, and my brain doesn't think in divs. I'm accustomed to such strict semantic structures that didn't employ them. So in the 21-day-responsive-design-course challenges, I've stumbled when the obvious way to get all the elements to move away from the left side of the viewport is to wrap them with a div. Such cheating! I think I am starting to make the switch conceptually.</li>
<li>I'm doing what the [self-directed online] class advises, which is to move slowly and get sure-footed about certain fundamentals: setting width (in percent, not pixels), setting max-width (in pixels). Avoiding setting font sizes in ems, though using ems for setting margins and padding. Understanding when rems may be preferable. Setting margin: 0 auto. These are the basics of setting up the page that are helping me a lot. </li>
<li>Bit the bullet and installed a google font even though the typographers look down on that. And whaddayaknow, setting font weight with Roboto doesn't work...and the forums confirm that something is hosed. Am ignoring the problem.</li>
<li><p>I'm making very slow progress with regard to making more sketches. Am thinking about Ii, Finland, where my great-grandmother is from, and rereading what my mom has written about her history.</p>
<p>I became really frustrated last night after one too many people posted something on Facebook about their trip to Mexico, and another about their Texas vacation and airplane trips. And then one of the Quakers at business meeting wanted to know whether now the old people can gather at the meetinghouse now that they're vaccinated. I was talking with Gail and said damn it, my great grandmother Anna was born in 1850. When she was three her mother died in childbirth. Anna's father was later to lose two more wives, and 16 of his 24 children. This area of Finland traded salted salmon and dried codfish, and furs, and tar for the shipbuilding industry. The same year that 3-year-old Anna lost her mother is the same year the Crimean War began, and British and French ships attacked this area, destroying ships and setting fires to the tar supplies and to lumber supplies. Finland was not yet independent, and she was considered an enemy because her ships sailed under the Russian flag.</p>
<p>As Anna was a child in the 1860s, Finland entered a decade of famine. About ten percent of the population died from starvation and disease. We learned that beggars roamed the countryside and people subsisted on tree bark mixed with flour, and soup made with reindeer moss and milk.</p>

<p>The winter she was 18, Anna left home and skiied 400 miles to the portion of Norway that is north of Finland and on the Arctic Circle. The family story is that Anna had wanted to share the family's meager amount of food with neighbors who had nothing, and that tensions had arisen between Anna and her stepmother. You know it's bad when skiing 400 miles to the Arctic Ocean is your best option. At least there, people knew, there was fish. The stories the routes to Norway along the frozen rivers were lined with the bodies of people who died aong the way.</p>
<p>Anna made it to a Finnish settlement in Norway (Vadso, Norway). She met and later married another Finnish immigrant, likely an orphan, and this man was to later die in a mine fire in the UP. It was Michigan's worst mining disaster, a tragedy perhaps made worse--so say the families of the dead, although the mining company denied it--by the mining company's decision to seal the mine. Sealing the mine closed it, suffocating the fire and anyone underground in an attempt to save the mine's wood timbers at the expense of the miners below. And there was Anna, a young widow, burying her husband in an unmarked grave and later making her way to Minnesota.</p>

<p>So right now I feel furious at people who have no sense of proportion about what difficulty can look like. I also don't know how that informs using grid and the DOM in conjunction with a plat map and responsive design. I think it has to do with reindeer cut off from their migration paths by fences, and the cattle on that Sebeka farm, and probably the cinder block chicken coop in which my mother was born. Maybe those Finnish streams and the bodies that lined them. I'll figure it out.</p>
  
</ul>

<h3>Goals from last week, which I'm working through</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure my pages can be successfully read by NVDA.</li>
    <li>Each day, make one more day of progress through the 28-day responsive design curriculum and exercises, assuming they are helpful.</li>
    <li>Learn enough to decide whether using the iPad pencil makes sense.</li>
    <li>Write more about my approach to the works. At least one more paragraph.</li>
    <li>Get out the plat map from the box of my parent's stuff and look at it again.</li>
    <li>Make more sketches. For now, get rid of canvas if it's too much to figure out what's going on with it. </li>
  </ul>
